<h2 class="fs150">PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="r15a" />

<p class="noindent">In the present volume, while describing the various operations
involved in the manufacture of paper, the Author
has endeavoured to render the work serviceable as a book
of reference in respect to the processes and improvements
which have from time to time been introduced, and many
of which have been more or less practically applied either
at home or abroad.</p>

<p>The recovery of soda from waste liquors has been fully
dealt with, and the details of several applied processes
explained.</p>

<p>Special attention has also been directed to some of the
more important methods of producing pulp from wood
fibre, since it is highly probable that from this inexhaustible
source the paper-maker will ultimately derive much
of the cellulose used in his manufacture. Indeed it may
be deemed equally probable, when the processes for disintegrating
wood fibre, so largely applied in America
and on the Continent, become better understood in this
country, that their adoption here will become more extensive
than has hitherto been the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>To render the work more readily understood alike by
the practical operator and the student, care has been
taken to avoid, as far as possible, the introduction of
unexplained technicalities; at the same time it has been
the writer's aim to furnish the reader with a variety of
information which, it is hoped, will prove both useful and
instructive.</p>

<p>It is with much pleasure that the Author tenders his
sincere thanks to Mr. Sydney Spalding, of the Horton
Kirby Mills, South Darenth, for his kind courtesy in
conducting him through the various departments of the
mill, and for explaining to him the operations performed
therein. To Mr. Frank Lloyd he also acknowledges his
indebtedness for the generous readiness with which he
accompanied him over the <em>Daily Chronicle</em> Mill at Sittingbourne,
and for the pains he took to supply information
as to certain details at the Author's request. His best
thanks are also due to those manufacturers of paper-making
machinery who supplied him with many of the
blocks which illustrate the pages of the book.</p>

    </div>

<p class="noindent"><b>Cellulose.</b>&mdash;Vegetable fibre, when deprived of all incrusting
or cementing matters of a resinous or gummy nature,
presents to us the true fibre, or <em>cellulose</em>, which constitutes
the essential basis of all manufactured paper. Fine linen
and cotton are almost pure cellulose, from the fact that
the associated vegetable substances have been removed by
the treatment the fibres were subjected to in the process
of their manufacture; pure white, unsized, and unloaded
paper may also be considered as pure cellulose from the
same cause. Viewed as a chemical substance, cellulose is
white, translucent, and somewhat heavier than water. It
is tasteless, inodorous, absolutely innutritious, and is insoluble
in water, alcohol, and oils. Dilute acids and
alkalies, even when hot, scarcely affect it. By prolonged
boiling in dilute acids, however, cellulose undergoes a
gradual change, being converted into <em>hydro-cellulose</em>. It
is also affected by boiling water alone, especially under
high pressure, if boiled for a lengthened period. Without
going deeply into the chemical properties of cellulose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
which would be more interesting to the chemist than to
the paper manufacturer, a few data respecting the action
of certain chemical substances upon cellulose will, it is
hoped, be found useful from a practical point of view,
especially at the present day, when so many new methods
of treating vegetable fibres are being introduced.</p>


<p><b>Action of Acids on Cellulose.</b>&mdash;When concentrated
sulphuric acid is added very gradually to about half its
weight of linen rags cut into small shreds, or strips of unsized
paper, and contained in a glass vessel, with constant
stirring, the fibres gradually swell up and disappear, without
the evolution of any gas, and a tenacious mucilage is
formed which is entirely soluble in water. If, after a few
hours, the mixture be diluted with water, the acid neutralised
with chalk, and after filtration, any excess of lime
thrown down by cautiously adding a solution of oxalic
acid, the liquid yields, after a second filtration and the
addition of alcohol in considerable excess, a gummy mass
which possesses all the characters of <em>dextrin</em>. If instead
of at once saturating the diluted acid with chalk, we boil
it for four or five hours, the <em>dextrin</em> is entirely converted
into grape sugar (<em>glucose</em>), which, by the addition of chalk
and filtration, as before, and evaporation at a gentle heat
to the consistence of a syrup, will, after repose for a few
days, furnish a concrete mass of crystallised sugar. Cotton,
linen, or unsized paper, thus treated, yield fully their own
weight of gum and one-sixth of their weight of grape
sugar. Pure cellulose is readily attacked by, and soon
becomes dissolved in, a solution of oxide of copper in
ammonia (<em>cuprammonium</em>), and may again be precipitated
in colourless flakes by the addition of an excess of hydrochloric
acid, and afterwards filtering and washing the
precipitate. Concentrated boiling hydrochloric acid converts
cellulose into a fine powder, without, however, altering
its composition, while strong nitric acid forms nitro-substitution
products of various degrees, according to the
strength of the acid employed. "Chlorine gas passed
into water in which cellulose is suspended rapidly oxidises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and destroys it, and the same effect takes place when
hypochlorites, such as hypochlorite of calcium, or bleaching
liquors, are gently treated with it. It is not, therefore,
the cellulose itself which we want the bleaching
liquor to operate upon, but only the colouring matters
associated with it, and care must be taken to secure that
the action intended for the extraneous substances alone
does not extend to the fibre itself. Caustic potash affects
but slightly cellulose in the form in which we have to do
it, but in certain less compact conditions these agents
decompose or destroy it."&mdash;<cite>Arnot.</cite><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>


<p><b>Physical Characteristics of Cellulose.</b>&mdash;"The physical
condition of cellulose," says Mr. Arnot, "after it has been
freed from extraneous matters by boiling, bleaching, and
washing, is of great importance to the manufacturer.
Some fibres are short, hard, and of polished exterior,
while others are long, flexible, and barbed, the former, it
is scarcely necessary to say, yielding but indifferent
papers, easily broken and torn, while the papers produced
from the latter class of fibres are possessed of a great
degree of strength and flexibility. Fibres from straw,
and from many varieties of wood, may be taken as representatives
of the former class, those from hemp and flax
affording good illustrations of the latter. There are, of
course, between these extremes all degrees and combinations
of the various characteristics indicated. It will be
readily understood that hard, acicular<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> fibres do not felt
well, there being no intertwining or adhesion of the various
particles, and the paper produced is friable. On the
other hand, long, flexible, elastic fibres, even though comparatively
smooth in their exterior, intertwine readily,
and felt into a strong tough sheet.... Cotton fibre is
long and tubular, and has this peculiarity, that when dry
the tubes collapse and twist on their axes, this property
greatly assisting the adhesion of the particles in the process
of paper-making. In the process of dyeing cotton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>the colouring matter is absorbed into the tubes, and is, as
will be readily appreciated, difficult of removal therefrom.
Papers made exclusively of cotton fibre are strong and
flexible, but have a certain sponginess about them which
papers made from linen do not possess."</p>

<p>Linen&mdash;the cellulose of the flax-plant&mdash;before it reaches
the hands of the paper-maker has been subjected to certain
processes of steeping or <em>retting</em>, and also subsequent
boilings and bleachings, by which the extraneous matters
have been removed, and it therefore requires but little
chemical treatment at his hands. "Linen fibre," Arnot
further observes, "is like cotton, tubular, but the walls of
the tubes are somewhat thicker, and are jointed or notched
like a cane or rush; the notches assist greatly in the adhesion
of the fibres one to another. This fibre possesses the
other valuable properties of length, strength, and flexibility,
and the latter property is increased when the walls of the
tubes are crushed together under the action of the beating-engine."
From this fibre a very strong, compactly felted
paper is made; indeed, no better material than this can be
had for the production of a first-class paper. Ropes, coarse
bags, and suchlike are made from hemp, the cellulose or fibre
of which is not unlike that of flax, only it is of a stronger,
coarser nature. Manilla<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> yields the strongest of all fibres.
Jute, which is the fibre or inside bark of an Indian plant
(<em>Corchorus capsularis</em>), yields a strong fibre, but is very
difficult to bleach white. Esparto fibre holds an intermediate
place between the fibres just described and those of
wood and straw.... The fibre of straw is short, pointed,
and polished, and cannot of itself make a strong paper.
The nature of wood fibre depends, as may readily be supposed,
upon the nature of the wood itself. Yellow pine,
for example, yields a fibre long, soft, and flexible, in fact
very like cotton; while oak and many other woods yield
short circular fibres which, unless perfectly free from
extraneous matters, possess no flexibility, and in any case
are not elastic.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Micrographic Examination of Vegetable Fibres.</b>&mdash;The
importance of the microscope in the examination of the
various fibres that are employed in paper manufacture will
be readily evident from the delicate nature of the cellulose
to be obtained therefrom.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Amongst others M. Girard
has determined, by this method of examination, the qualities
which fibres ought to possess to suit the requirements
of the manufacturer. He states that absolute length is
not of much importance, but that the fibre should be
slender and elastic, and possess the property of turning
upon itself with facility. Tenacity is of but secondary
importance, for when paper is torn the fibres scarcely ever
break. The principal fibres employed in paper-making
are divided into the following classes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>1. <em>Round</em>, <em>ribbed fibres</em>, as hemp and flax.</p>

<p>2. <em>Smooth</em>, or <em>feebly-ribbed fibres</em>, as esparto, jute, phormium
(New Zealand flax), dwarf palm, hop, and
sugar-cane.</p>

<p>3. <em>Fibro-cellular substances</em>, as the pulp obtained from
the straw of wheat and rye by the action of caustic
ley.</p>

<p>4. <em>Flat fibres</em>, as cotton, and those obtained by the action
of caustic ley upon wood.</p>

<p>5. <em>Imperfect substances</em>, as the pulp obtained from sawdust.
In this class may also be included the fibre
of the so-called "mechanical wood pulp."</p></div>


<p><b>Determination of Cellulose.</b> For the determination of
cellulose in wood and other vegetable fibres to be used in
paper-making Müller recommends the following processes:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
5 grammes weight of the finely-divided substance
is boiled four or five times in water, using 100 cubic
centimètres<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> each time. The residue is then dried at
100° C. (212° Fahr.), weighed, and exhausted with a mixture
of equal measures of benzine and strong alcohol, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>remove fat, wax, resin, &amp;c. The residue is again dried and
boiled several times in water, to every 100 c.c. of which
1 c.c. of strong ammonia has been added. This treatment
removes colouring matter and pectous<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> substances. The
residue is further bruised in a mortar if necessary, and is
then treated in a closed bottle with 250 c.c. of water, and
20 c.c. of bromine water containing 4 c.c. of bromine to
the litre.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In the case of the purer bark-fibres, such as
flax and hemp, the yellow colour of the liquid only slowly
disappears, but with straw and woods decolorisation occurs
in a few minutes, and when this takes place more bromine
water is added, this being repeated until the yellow colour
remains, and bromine can be detected in the liquid after
twelve hours. The liquid is then filtered, and the residue
washed with water and heated to boiling with a litre of
water containing 5 c.c. of strong ammonia. The liquid
and tissue are usually coloured brown by this treatment.
The undissolved matter is filtered off, washed, and again
treated with bromine water. When the action seems complete
the residue is again heated with ammoniacal water.
This second treatment is sufficient with the purer fibres,
but the operation must be repeated as often as the residue
imparts a brownish tint to the alkaline liquid. The
cellulose is thus obtained as a pure white body; it
is washed with water, and then with boiling alcohol,
after which it may be dried at 100° C. (212° Fahr.) and
weighed.</p>


<p><b>Recognition of Vegetable Fibres by the Microscope.</b>&mdash;From
Mr. Allen's admirable and useful work on "Commercial
Organic Analysis"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> we make the following extracts,
but must refer the reader to the work named for
fuller information upon this important consideration of
the subject. In examining fibres under the microscope,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>it is recommended that the tissues should be cut up with
sharp scissors, placed on a glass slide, moistened with
water, and covered with a piece of thin glass. Under these
conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Filaments of Cotton</em> appear as transparent tubes, flattened
and twisted round their axes, and tapering off to a
closed point at each end. A section of the filament somewhat
resembles the figure 8, the tube, originally cylindrical,
having collapsed most in the middle, forming semi-tubes
on each side, which give the fibre, when viewed
in certain lights, the appearance of a flat ribbon, with the
hem of the border at each edge. The twisted, or corkscrew
form of the dried filament of cotton distinguishes it from
all other vegetable fibres, and is characteristic of the matured
pod, M. Bauer having found that the fibres of the
unripe seed are simply untwisted cylindrical tubes, which
never twist afterwards if separated from the plant. The
matured fibres always collapse in the middle as described,
and undergo no change in this respect when passing
through all the various operations to which cotton is subject,
from spinning to its conversion into pulp for paper-making.</p>

<p><em>Linen</em>, <em>or Flax Fibre</em>, under the microscope, appears as
hollow tubes, open at both ends, the fibres being smooth,
and the inner tube very narrow, and joints, or <em>septa</em>,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
appear at intervals, but are not furnished with hairy
appendages as is the case with hemp. When flax fibre is
immersed in a boiling solution of equal parts of caustic
potash and water for about a minute, then removed and
pressed between folds of filter-paper, it assumes a dark
yellow colour, whilst cotton under the same treatment
remains white or becomes very bright yellow. When flax,
or a tissue made from it, is immersed in oil, and then well
pressed to remove excess of the liquid, it remains translucent,
while cotton, under the same conditions, becomes
opaque.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><em>New Zealand Flax</em> (<em>Phormium tenax</em>) may be distinguished
from ordinary flax or hemp by a reddish colour
produced on immersing it first in a strong chlorine water,
and then in ammonia. In machine-dressed New Zealand
flax the bundles are translucent and irregularly covered
with tissue; spiral fibres can be detected in the bundles,
but less numerous than in Sizal. In Maori-prepared
phormium the bundles are almost wholly free from tissue,
while there are no spiral fibres.</p>

<p><em>Hemp Fibre</em> resembles flax, and exhibits small hairy
appendages at the joints. In Manilla hemp the bundles
are oval, nearly opaque, and surrounded by a considerable
quantity of dried-up cellular tissue composed of rectangular
cells. The bundles are smooth, very few detached
ultimate fibres are seen, and no spiral tissue.</p>

<p><em>Sizal</em>, <em>or Sisal Hemp</em> (<em>Agave Americana</em>), forms oval
fibrous bundles surrounded by cellular tissue, a few smooth
ultimate fibres projecting from the bundles; is more translucent
than Manilla, and a large quantity of spiral fibres
are mixed up in the bundles.</p>

<p><em>Jute Fibre</em> appears under the microscope as bundles of
tendrils, each being a cylinder, with irregular thickened
walls. The bundles offer a smooth cylindrical surface, to
which the silky lustre of jute is due, and which is much
increased by bleaching. By the action of hypochlorite of
soda the bundles of fibres can be disintegrated, so that the
single fibres can be readily distinguished under the microscope.
Jute is coloured a deeper yellow by sulphate of
aniline than is any other fibre.</p>

<p class="noindent">In former days the only materials employed for the
manufacture of paper were linen and cotton rags, flax and
hemp waste, and some few other fibre-yielding materials.
The reduction of the excise duty, however, from 3d. to
1½d. per lb., which took effect in the first year of Her
Majesty's reign&mdash;namely, in 1837&mdash;created a greatly increased
demand for paper, and caused much anxiety
amongst manufacturers lest the supply of rags should
prove inadequate to their requirements. Again, in the
year 1861 the excise duty was totally abolished, from
which period an enormously increased demand for paper,
and consequently paper material, was created by the establishment
of a vast number of daily and weekly papers
and journals in all parts of the kingdom, besides reprints
of standard and other works in a cheap form, the copyright
of which had expired. It is not too much to say,
that unless other materials than those employed before the
repeal of the paper duty had been discovered, the abolition
of the impost would have proved but of little service to
the public at large. Beneficent Nature, however, has
gradually, but surely and amply, supplied our needs
through the instrumentality of man's restless activity and
perseverance.</p>

<p>The following list comprises many of the substances
from which cellulose, or vegetable fibre, can be separated
for the purposes of paper-making with advantage; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
vegetable kingdom furnishes in addition a vast number of
plants and vegetables which may also be used with the same
object. We have seen voluminous lists of fibre-yielding
materials which have been suggested as suitable for paper-making,
but since the greater portion of them are never
likely to be applied to such a purpose, we consider the
time wasted in proposing them. It is true that the stalks
of the cabbage tribe, for example, would be available for
the sake of their fibre, but we should imagine that no
grower of ordinary intelligence would deprive his ground
of the nourishment such waste is capable of <em>returning to
the soil</em>, by its employment as manure, to furnish a material
for paper-making. Again, we have seen blackberries,
and even the pollen (!) of plants included in a list of paper
materials, but fortunately the manufacturer is never likely
to be reduced to such extremities as to be compelled to
use materials of this nature.</p>

<p><b>Rags.</b>&mdash;Linen and cotton rags are imported into Great
Britain from almost all the countries of Europe, and even
from the distant states of South America, British South
Africa, and Australasia. The greater proportion, however,
come from Germany. The rags collected in England
chiefly pass through the hands of wholesale merchants
established in London, Liverpool, Manchester, and Bristol,
and these are sorted to a certain extent before they are
sent to the paper-mills. By this rough sorting, which
does not include either cleansing or disinfecting, certain
kinds of rags which would be useless to the paper-maker
are separated and sold as manure. Woollen rags are not
usually mixed with cotton rags, but are generally kept
apart to be converted into "shoddy." The importance of
disinfecting rags before they pass through the hands of
the workpeople employed at the paper-mills cannot be
over-estimated, and it is the duty of every Government to
see that this is effectually carried out, not only at such
times when cholera and other epidemics are known to be
rife in certain countries from which rags may be imported,
but at all times, since there is no greater source of danger
to the health of communities than in the diffusion of old
linen and cotton garments, or pieces, which are largely
contributed by the dwellers in the slums of crowded cities.</p>

<p>Respecting the disinfecting of rags, Davis<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> thus explains
the precautions taken in the United States to guard
against the dangers of infection from rags coming from
foreign or other sources. "When cholera, or other infectious
or contagious diseases exist in foreign countries,
or in portions of the United States, the health officers in
charge of the various quarantines in this country require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
that rags from countries and districts in which such
diseases are prevalent shall be thoroughly disinfected
before they are allowed to pass their stations. Rags
shipped to London, Hull, Liverpool, Italian, or other
ports, and re-shipped from such ports to the United
States, are usually subjected to the same rule as if shipped
direct from the ports of the country in which such
diseases prevail. It is usually requisite that the disinfection
shall be made at the storehouse in the port of shipment,
by boiling the rags several hours under a proper
degree of pressure, or in a tightly-closed vessel, or disinfected
with sulphurous acid, which is evolved by burning
at least two pounds of roll sulphur to every ten cubic feet
of room space, the apartment being kept closed for several
hours after the rags are thus treated. Disinfection by
boiling the rags is usually considered to be the best
method. In the case of rags imported from India, Egypt,
Spain, and other foreign countries where cholera is liable
to become epidemic, it is especially desirable that some
efficient, rapid, and thorough process of disinfecting
should be devised. In order to meet the quarantine
requirements, it must be thorough and certain in its
action, and in order that the lives of the workmen and of
others in the vicinity may not be endangered by the
liberating of active disease-germs, or exposure of decaying
and deleterious matters, and that the delay, trouble,
and exposure of unbaling and rebaling may be avoided, it
must be capable of use upon the rags while in the bale,
and of doing its work rapidly when so used."</p>


<p><b>Disinfecting Machine.</b>&mdash;To facilitate the disinfecting
of rags while in the bale, Messrs. Parker and Blackman
devised a machine, for which they obtained a patent in
1884, from which the following abstract is taken.</p>

<p>Formerly rags and other fibrous materials were disinfected
by being subjected to germ-destroying gases or
liquids in enclosed chambers, but in order to render the
disinfecting process effectual, it was found necessary to
treat the material in a loose or separated state, no successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
method having been adopted for disinfecting the
materials while in the bale. "This unbaling and loosening
or spreading of the undisinfected material is absolutely
unsafe and dangerous to the workmen, or to those
in the vicinity, because of the consequent setting free of
the disease germs, and the exposing of any decaying or
deleterious matters which may be held in the material
while it is compressed in the bale. The unbaling and necessary
rebaling of the material for transportation also involves
much trouble and expense and loss of time. Large
and cumbrous apparatus is also necessary to treat large
quantities of material loosened or opened out as heretofore."</p>

<p>It is specially necessary that rags coming from Egypt
and other foreign countries should be thoroughly disinfected
by some rapid and effectual means, which, while not
endangering the health of workmen employed in this somewhat
hazardous task, will fully meet all quarantine requirements.
The apparatus devised by Messrs. Parker and
Blackman,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> an abridged description of which is given
below, will probably accomplish this much-desired object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_014.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>In the illustration, Fig. 1, <span class="fs70">A</span> is the disinfecting chamber.
At one end is an opening <span class="fs70">A</span><sup>1</sup>, and a door <span class="fs70">B</span>, hinged
at its lower edge and adapted to be swung up, so as to
close the opening tightly. For supporting and carrying
the bale <span class="fs70">C</span> of material to be placed in the chamber is a
carriage <span class="fs70">C</span><sup>1</sup>, consisting of a platform supported upon
wheels or castors <em>c</em> <em>c</em>. While the carriage is wholly within
the chamber <span class="fs70">A</span>, as shown in Fig. 2, these wheels rest upon
the false bottom <span class="fs70">B</span><sup>2</sup>; when the carriage is rolled back
and out of the chamber, as shown in Fig. 1, they roll
upon the upper face of door <span class="fs70">B</span> swung down. The carriage
is provided with a clamping device <span class="fs70">D</span> to hold the bale
firmly and immovably. To cause the carriage to move
into and out of the chamber, the inventors provide upon
the under side of the platform a fixed sleeve <span class="fs70">E</span>, interiorly
threaded to fit the screw <span class="fs70">E</span><sup>1</sup>, journalled at one end near the
opening in the chamber end in a stationary block <span class="fs70">E</span><sup>2</sup> fixed
upon the false bottom <span class="fs70">B</span><sup>2</sup>. From this end the screw extends
along under the carriage through the screw sleeve
and to the other end of the chamber. A collar <em>e</em><sup>2</sup> on the
screw bears against the inner end of this journal-bearing,
and upon the end of the shank <em>e</em> bearing against the other
end of the journal is fixed a pinion <span class="fs70">F</span>, which is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
driven in either direction as desired. Above this journal-bearing
is a series of similar bearings (five being shown),
<span class="fs70">G</span> <span class="fs70">G</span>, passing through the wall of the chamber. Of these
the middle one is in a line with the centre of the bale,
supported and held on the carriage. The others are
arranged at the corners of a square. Journalled in these
bearings are the hollow shanks <span class="fs70">H</span> <span class="fs70">H</span> of the hollow screws
<span class="fs70">I</span> <span class="fs70">I</span> pointed at <span class="fs70">I</span><sup>1</sup> <span class="fs70">I</span><sup>1</sup>. Each screw is perforated, <em>i</em> <em>i</em>, between
the threads <em>i</em><sup>1</sup> <em>i</em><sup>1</sup> from the fixed collar <span class="fs70">K</span> <span class="fs70">K</span>. Upon the
tubular shanks <span class="fs70">H</span> <span class="fs70">H</span> of the screws are fixed the gear-wheels
<span class="fs70">L</span> <span class="fs70">L</span>. At a short distance from the end of the
chamber, <span class="fs70">A</span> is the hollow chamber or receptacle <span class="fs70">M</span>, into
which is to be forced the disinfectant liquid or gas. The
tubular shanks <span class="fs70">H</span> <span class="fs70">H</span> of the screws project through the
wall <span class="fs70">M</span>, passing through stuffing-boxes <em>m</em> <em>m</em>, and their
bores communicate with the interior of the chamber, the
shank of the middle screw being continued through the
opposite wall and a stuffing-box, its solid or projecting
end being provided with two fixed pulleys, <span class="fs70">N</span> <span class="fs70">N</span>, and a
loose pulley <span class="fs70">O</span>. When a gaseous disinfectant is used, it
can be forced by any desired means through the pipe <span class="fs70">S</span>
into the chamber. Where a liquid disinfectant is used,
an elevated tank <span class="fs70">R</span> containing the fluid may be used. As
most fibrous materials, and especially rags, are baled so as
to be in layers, it is preferable so to place the bale upon
the carriage that the perforated screws may penetrate the
material at right angles to the layers by which the gas or
liquid issuing through the holes in the screws passes in all
directions throughout the mass within the bale.</p>

<p>In the upper part of chamber <span class="fs70">A</span> are perforated shelves
<span class="fs70">V</span> <span class="fs70">V</span>, upon which, if desired, the material can be spread
out and subjected to disinfecting gas or vapour. On the
top of the chamber is a tank <span class="fs70">W</span> nearly filled with disinfecting
liquid. A passage <span class="fs70">W</span><sup>1</sup> extends from upper part of
the chamber up into the tank above the level of the liquid
therein, and is then carried at its end down below the surface
of the liquid. At its other end the tank is provided
at its top with a discharge opening <span class="fs70">X</span> and a suitable pipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<span class="fs70">X</span><sup>1</sup>, forming a continuation of the opening; by this means
all foul and deleterious vapours or gases passing out of
the closed chamber <span class="fs70">A</span> through the passage <span class="fs70">W</span> must pass
through the disinfecting liquid in the tank before escaping
through the opening <span class="fs70">X</span> and stack <span class="fs70">X</span><sup>1</sup> into the air, and
are thus rendered harmless.</p>

<p>When a sufficient amount of the disinfectant has been
forced into and through the bale, the disinfectant is turned
off, and cold dry air can be forced through chamber <span class="fs70">M</span>,
and out through the nozzles and bale, whereby the
material within the bale becomes cooled and dried, and all
the foul air from the chamber <span class="fs70">A</span> driven out, so that it may
be opened and entered with safety. Any suitable disinfectant
may be used with this apparatus, as, for example,
sulphurous acid, in gas or solution, superheated steam,
carbolic acid, or any solution or vapour containing
chlorine.</p>


<p><b>Straw.</b>&mdash;Very large quantities of this material are used
in the manufacture of paper, but more especially for newspapers,
the straw from wheat and oats being mostly employed.
Although the percentage of cellulose in straw is
about equal to that of esparto, the severe treatment it requires
to effectually remove the silicious coating by which
the fibre is protected, and to render the knots amenable
to the action of the bleach, greatly reduces the yield of
finished pulp. Many processes have been introduced
for the treatment of straw for paper-making, but the
most successful of them appear to be modifications
of a process introduced in 1853 by MM. Coupier and
Mellier.</p>


<p><b>Esparto Grass.</b>&mdash;This important fibrous material is
largely imported from Algeria, Spain, and other countries,
and constitutes one of the most valuable fibre-yielding
materials with which the manufacturer has to deal. Some
idea of the amount of esparto and other fibres which find
their way to our shores may be gleaned from the fact that
while the import of cotton and linen rags in the year 1884
was 36,233 tons, of the value of £487,866, that of esparto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and other fibres amounted to 184,005 tons, of the value of
£1,125,553.</p>


<p><b>Wood.</b>&mdash;As a paper-making material, the fibre obtained
from various kinds of wood now holds an important position,
since the sources of supply are practically inexhaustible.
The first practical process for manufacturing
pulp from wood fibre was perfected and introduced by the
author's father, the late Mr. Charles Watt, who, in conjunction
with Mr. H. Burgess, obtained a patent for the
invention on August 19th, 1853. The process was afterwards
publicly exhibited at a small works on the Regent's
Canal, when the Earl of Derby (then Lord Stanley), many
scientific men and representatives of the press, were
present, and expressed themselves well satisfied with its
success. Specimens of the wood paper, including a copy
of the <em>Weekly Times</em> printed thereon, were exhibited, as
also some water-colour drawings which had been produced
upon paper made from wood pulp. Failing to get the
process taken up in England, an American patent was
applied for and obtained in 1854, which was subsequently
purchased; but with the exception of an instalment, the
purchase-money was never paid to the inventor! Thus
the process "got" into other hands, the original inventor
alone being unbenefited by it.</p>

<p>It has been repeatedly stated,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> no doubt unwittingly,
that a person named Houghton first introduced the wood
paper process into this country; but considering that his
patent was not obtained until 1857, or four years after the
process above referred to was patented and publicly exhibited
in England, it will be seen that the statement is
absolutely without foundation. The first knowledge Mr.
Houghton received concerning wood as a paper-making
material was from the author's father, and he (Mr. Houghton),
in conjunction with Mr. Burgess, introduced the
Watt and Burgess process into America in the year 1854.
These are the facts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Bamboo</b> (<em>Bambusa vulgaris</em>).&mdash;The leaves and fresh-cut
stems of this plant are used for paper material, but require
to pass through a preliminary process of crushing, which
is effected by suitable rolls, the second series of crushing
rolls being grooved or channelled to split or divide the
material, after which the stems are cut to suitable lengths
for boiling.</p>


<p><b>Paper Mulberry</b> (<em>Broussonetia papyrifera</em>).&mdash;The inner
bark of this tree, and also some other basts, have long been
used by the Japanese and Chinese in the manufacture of
paper of great strength, but of extreme delicacy.</p>

to free them from dirty matters, dust, and even
sand, which is sometimes fraudulently introduced into
rags to increase their weight. This preliminary treatment
may be classified under the following heads, namely:&mdash;Sorting;
Cutting; Willowing; Dusting.</p>


<p><b>Sorting.</b>&mdash;The rags being removed from the bags or
bales in which they are packed, require first to be sorted
according to the nature and quality of the fabrics of
which they are composed; thus linen, cotton, hemp, wool,
&amp;c., must be carefully separated from each other; the
thickness of the substance, its condition as to the wear it
has undergone, and the colour of the material, all these
considerations are taken into account by the women and
girls who are employed in the operation of sorting. The
finer qualities are set aside for writing-paper, inferior
sorts being used separately, or mixed, according to the
requirements of the manufacturer. Blue rags are generally
separated from the rest and kept for the manufacture
of blue paper, but most of the other coloured rags require
bleaching. In sorting rags, a good deal of judgment and
skill are required to avoid mixing the better qualities with
those of an inferior class, which would occasion loss in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
manufacture. It is also important that those of inferior
colour should not be mixed with the finer qualities, which
would be liable to affect the colour and deteriorate the
quality of the paper. Paper manufacturers generally
classify the rags obtained from home sources, that is, from
different parts of the United Kingdom, under the following
heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>Woollen rags are only used to a very moderate extent
in blotting and filtering papers and also in coarse papers
and wrappers. Many attempts have been made to bleach
woollen rags, but the severity of the treatment required
invariably ended in a destruction of the fibrous substances
mingled with them. It is customary to dispose of such
material for re-making into common cloths, and for
shoddy. Rags collected in large cities, in consequence
of the frequent bleachings they have been subjected to,
are considerably weakened in fibre, tearing easily, and are
therefore subject to loss in process of manufacture into
pulp. Country rags, being coarser and greyer because less
bleached, are stronger in fibre and give a better body to
the paper. In sampling rags it is necessary to take precautions
against the fraudulent "tricks of the trade,"
which are often resorted to to cheat the manufacturer.
Samples should be taken from the interior of the bags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
or bales, to ascertain if the material in the interior
is equal in quality with that at the outside&mdash;that is
to say, that the quality is fairly averaged throughout. It
may also be found that the rags have been purposely
wetted to increase their weight. If such is found to be
the case, a few handfuls should be weighed, and then
dried in a warm room, and afterwards re-weighed, when
if the loss exceeds 5 to 7 per cent. it may be assumed
that the rags have been fraudulently wetted. It is generally
found, however, that the merchants in the principal
towns transact their business honourably and are therefore
reliable.</p>

<p>The sorting is generally performed by women, who not
only separate the various qualities of the rags, which
they place in separate receptacles, but also remove all
buttons, hooks and eyes, india-rubber, pins and needles,
&amp;c., and loosen all seams, hems and knots. The rags
are next carefully looked over by women called <em>over-haulers</em>,
or over-lookers, whose duty it is to see that the
previous operations have been fully carried out in all
respects. Usually there is one over-hauler to every eight
or ten <em>cutters</em>.</p>


<p><b>Cutting.</b>&mdash;In some mills it is preferred to have the rags
cut into pieces from 2 to 4 inches square, but the actual
size is not considered of much importance. The chief
object is to have them in such a condition that they may
be thoroughly cleansed in subsequent operations, and able
to float throughout the water in the rag-engine, without
twisting round the roller. If the rag pieces are smaller
than is required to effect this it tends to create a loss of
fibre in the operations of willowing and dusting.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_b_023.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>The process of cutting is performed by hand or
by machinery. When the rags are cut by hand, the
operation, which is accomplished by women, is conducted
as follows:&mdash;The cutter takes her place in front of an
oblong box, as in Fig. 3, covered with coarse wire netting,
containing three threads per inch, through which dust,
&amp;c., passes to a receptacle beneath; in the centre is fixed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in a slanting position, a large-bladed knife of peculiar
form, with its back towards the operator, who is surrounded
by a number of
boxes, corresponding with
the number of the different
qualities of rags;
these are lined at the bottom
with coarse wire
gauze. In the operation
of cutting, if any foreign
substances, such as buttons,
hooks, &amp;c., which
may have escaped the
sorters are found, these
are at once removed. The
rags as they are cut are
put into baskets to be
conveyed to the rag-engine room. In some mills rags
are cut by machinery, but hand cutting is usually adopted
for the better kinds of paper, as it is obvious that the
machine would not be able to reject, as is the case in
hand cutting, unpicked seams and other irregularities
which may have escaped observation by the sorters and
overhaulers. Machine cutting is, therefore, generally
adopted for the materials which are to be used for the
coarser papers. There are several rag-cutting machines
in use, of which one or two examples are given below.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_024.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 4.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Bertrams' Rag-Cutting Machine.</b>&mdash;The engraving,
Fig. 4, represents a machine manufactured by Messrs.
Bertrams, Limited, of St. Katherine's Works, Edinburgh,
to whose courtesy we are indebted for this
and other illustrations of their machinery, which have
been reproduced in outline from their illustrated catalogue.
The machine, which is suitable either for rags or
ropes, has three revolving knives, and one dead knife,
which is rendered reversible to four edges, and has self-acting
feed gear, side frames, drum, and other connections
of substantial construction; it is wood covered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
furnished with sheet-iron delivery spout. The material
passes into the machine along the table at <em>a</em>, where it
passes between the dead knife <em>c</em> and the knives <em>b</em> fixed to
the revolving drum <em>d</em>. The cut rags fall into a receptacle
beneath the drum.</p>


<p><b>Nuttall's Rag Cutter.</b>&mdash;Another type of rag cutter,
and which is also suitable for cutting bagging, sailcloth,
tarpaulin, Manilla and other fibres, is Nuttall's Rag Cutter,
a drawing of which is shown in Fig. 5. This
machine is manufactured by Messrs. Bentley and Jackson,
of Bury, near Manchester, and is generally known as
the "Guillotine Rag Cutter," from the principle of its
action, which is that of chopping the material. The
machine is adopted at many mills, and a large-sized
machine has recently been put down at the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>
mills, Dartford. A medium-sized machine will cut
about one ton of rags in an hour.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 5.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Willowing.</b>&mdash;In some mills the cut rags are conveyed
to a machine called the "willow," which in one form of
machine consists of two cast-iron cylinders, 2½ feet in diameter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and 3½ feet wide, provided with numerous iron
teeth, which project about 4 inches. These cylinders are
placed one behind the other, and beneath them is a semi-circular
screw, and above them a cover of the same form.
This cover is also furnished with teeth, and is so adjusted
that the teeth in the cylinders pass those in the cover at
a distance of ½ to ¾ of an inch. In front are a pair of
rollers and revolving apron, which carry the rags into the
cylinders, which rotate rapidly; and the rags, which are
thrown by the first into the second cylinder, are allowed
to remain in them for about 20 seconds, when a sliding
door, which rises three times per minute, allows the rags
to be discharged into a duster. Each time the sliding
door opens the revolving apron moves forward and recharges
the willow with a fresh supply. The rags, after
being beaten and teazed in the willow, are considerably
loosened in texture, and a good deal of dust and gritty
matters fall through the screen beneath.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_026.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 6.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 6 represents a combined willow and duster, specially
useful for waste rags and jute, but may be used for
all fibres, manufactured by Bertrams, Limited, the main
features of which are thus described:&mdash;"There are two
drums, which have malleable-iron cross-bars and teeth,
and malleable-iron harp motion below for escape of dust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
The framework of the willow is of cast iron, and the sides
are filled in with cast-iron panel doors, the top being
covered in with sheet iron. The gear is arranged so that
the willow will deliver to the duster or otherwise by self-acting
motion continuously or intermittently. The feed
to the willow can also be made continuous or intermittent.
The drums, framework, panels, and casing being made of
iron, the chance of fire from the friction of its working is
reduced to a minimum. The duster, as a rule, is 12 feet
long, about 5 feet in diameter, and has eight longitudinal
bars of cast iron fitted between the front and end revolving
rings. These bars are fitted with malleable-iron spikes,
pitched and so arranged that the rags or fibres are delivered
at the exit end automatically. The outside of the duster
can be lined with wire-cloth, perforated zinc, iron, etc.
It is driven by outside shafts and friction gear, so that
there is no internal shaft to interfere with the delivery of
the fibres."</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 7.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Dusting.</b>&mdash;In Fig. 7 is shown a rag-dusting machine,
manufactured by Messrs. Bryan Donkin and Co., of Bermondsey,
London. The cylinder of this machine, which
is conical in form, to enable the rags to travel from one
end to the other, whence they are ejected, revolves, as
also does a second cylinder of a skeleton form, but in
the opposite direction. Each cylinder is fitted with
knives, or spikes&mdash;those of the outer cylinder projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
towards the centre; the knives of the centre cylinder
being attached to its exterior surface: when the machine
is in motion the two sets of blades pass each other so
that when the rags come between them the action is that
of scissors. When the rags are ejected at the end of the
cylinder, they pass into another cylinder of wire, through
which the dust falls and leaves them in a fairly clean
condition, when they are lowered through a trap-door to
the boiling room below.</p>

<p><b>Donkin's "Devil."</b>&mdash;For removing the dust and dirt
from coarse and very dirty rags, oakum, rope, etc., the
presence of which would seriously injure the quality of
the paper, a still more powerful machine has been introduced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
called the "devil," which is constructed on the
same principle as the willow, but revolves at a lower
speed. The revolving axle of this machine is conical, and
is provided with teeth, arranged in a spiral form. The
case in which it rotates is fed continuously, instead of
intermittently; and although it facilitates the subsequent
treatment of the fibre, it is said to be wasteful, while also
consuming a considerable amount of power. A machine,
or "devil," for cleaning rags or half stuff is manufactured
by Messrs. Donkin and Co., a representation of which
is shown in Fig. 8.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Boiling Rags.</b>&mdash;To remove greasy matters, and also to
dissolve out the cementing substances from the stems of
flax and shell of the cotton, the rags are next boiled in a
solution of caustic soda, caustic lime, or a mixture of carbonate
of soda and lime. The boiling has also the effect
of loosening the dirt contained in the rags, whereby the
colour of the material is greatly improved, while at the
same time it is rendered more susceptible to the action of
the bleaching agent. Strong linen rags will sometimes
lose from one-third to one-fifth of their weight by the
process of boiling. The vessels for boiling rags are of
various construction, and have been the subject of numerous
ingenious patents. These boilers are either cylindrical
or spherical, and are also stationary or rotary&mdash;the
latter form being devised for the purpose of keeping the
caustic alkali solution freely diffused throughout the mass
of fibre during the boiling.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 9.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Bertrams' Rag Boiler.</b>&mdash;An illustration of a spherical
boiler, as manufactured by Bertrams, Limited, of Edinburgh,
is given in Fig. 9. The shell of this boiler is
made from malleable iron, is 8 feet in diameter and
9 feet deep. The boiler is constructed on what is termed
the "vomiting" principle, by which a free circulation of
the alkaline liquor is constantly maintained. These boilers
are made to withstand any pressure of steam, but the size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
given is usually worked at from 35 to 45 lbs. pressure,
and carries about 30 cwt. of dry esparto.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_031.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 10.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Donkin's Rag Boiler.</b>&mdash;The spherical boiler of Messrs.
Bryan Donkin and Co. is shown in Fig. 10. Being of
a spherical form, it is twice as strong as a cylindrical
boiler of the same diameter and thickness. The plates
used are, notwithstanding, of the usual substance, thus
rendering it perfectly safe, durable, and suitable for high-pressure
steam. The spherical shape also allows the rags
to fall out by themselves when the boiler is revolving
with the cover off. Within the boiler are strainers to
carry off the dirt, and lifters to agitate the rags during
the process of either boiling or washing. To avoid
cement, or even lead joints, the gudgeons and the boiler
are turned true in the lathe to fit each other, the joints
being simply made with red lead. These boilers are
usually about 8 feet in diameter, and are capable of boiling
from 20 cwt. to 25 cwt. of rags. The idea of giving
motion to the boiler, so as to insure a perfect mixture
of the rags and the caustic liquor, is of American origin,
and was first introduced into this country by Messrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Bryan Donkin and Co. It is usual to fix the boiler so
that it can be fed with rags through a trap in the floor
above, while the boiler is in a vertical position and the lid
removed. The trunnions are hollow, to admit the introduction
of steam, alkaline ley, or water, and its rotary
motion, which is about three times in two minutes, is given
by the gearing on the left of the illustration.</p>

<p>The alkalies used for boiling rags are either caustic
soda, soda ash, slaked lime, made into a cream and sifted,
or a mixture of slaked lime and carbonate of soda. A
description of the preparation of caustic soda ley will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
found in another chapter. It has been customary at
most of the larger paper-mills to purchase their caustic
soda direct from the alkali manufacturers, who supply
it in a solid form enclosed in iron drums, hermetically
closed, which are broken and the contents removed
and dissolved when required for use. As to the strength
of caustic soda liquor to be used for boiling rags, this
is regulated according to the nature and condition of
the material, and the quality of the paper it is intended
for (see <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>). For the finest papers the caustic soda
should be perfectly pure, and as there are various grades
of this chemical substance sold by the alkali makers,
only the purer qualities are used for the better kinds
of paper. The proportion of caustic soda per cwt. of
rags varies to the extent of from 5 to 10 per cent. of
the former to each cwt. of the latter, the coarser materials,
of course, requiring more alkali than those of finer
quality. In cases where rags are boiled in an open
boiler&mdash;as was formerly the case&mdash;a much larger proportion
of caustic soda would be required than when the
boiling is conducted under high pressures, as is now very
generally the custom. In boiling the finer qualities of
rags, less pressure of steam is required than for the coarser
qualities, and the heat being proportionately lower, there
is less destruction of the fibre. Some paper-makers prefer
to boil the rags with caustic lime only, in which case the
lime, after being slaked in the usual way, is mixed with
water until it attains a milky consistence, when it is
passed through a sieve to separate any solid particles
which may be present. About the same percentage of
lime may be used as in the former case.</p>

<p>When a mixture of lime and carbonate of soda is used, a
method much adopted on the Continent, the lime should be
well screened from lumps before being mixed with the soda.
The usual method of preparing this mixture is as follows:&mdash;A
wooden tank, 15 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 4 feet
deep is divided into three compartments, each of which
has a false bottom perforated with ½-inch holes to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
back lumps, stones, pieces of coal, etc., which frequently
abound in the lime. The fresh lime is put into the first
compartment, where it is slaked with water in the usual
way; the resulting powder is then put into the next compartment
together with sufficient water, where it is agitated
until converted into what is technically termed "milk of
lime." In the partition which separates the second from
the third division is a movable sluice, through which the
milk of lime flows into the third compartment; in this is
fitted a revolving drum, similar to the drum-washer of
the breaking-engine, through which the milk of lime
which flows from the sluice becomes strained, and is lifted
in the same way as water is lifted by the drum-washer of
the breaking-engine, and is thence discharged through a
pipe into the rag boilers; an additional straining can be
effected by placing a fine wire strainer over the mouth of
this pipe leading to the boiler, which will prevent objectionable
particles from entering the boiler. Each compartment
is provided with a large waste pipe, through
which, by the aid of a sufficient supply of water, all impurities
which have been rejected by the drum are carried
away. The soda solution is prepared by dissolving the
required proportion in water, and the resulting liquor,
after careful straining, is introduced into the boiler to
which the charge of rags has been given; the head of the
boiler is then fixed in its position and steam turned on,
until a pressure of about 20 to 30 lbs. to the square inch
is attained, and the boiling kept up for two to six hours,
according to the quality of the rags. By the Continental
system of boiling rags, for No. 1 stuffs, 216 lbs. of lime
and 114 lbs., of 48 per cent., soda ash are used for every
4,000 lbs. of rags; for Nos. 3 and 5 stuffs, 324 lbs. of
lime and 152 lbs. of soda ash are used; and for No. 4
stuff 378 lbs. of lime and 190 lbs. of soda ash, and the
boiling in each case is kept up for twelve hours, under a
pressure of 30 lbs., the operation being conducted in
boilers which revolve horizontally.</p>

<p>In boiling the finest qualities of rags, it is considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
preferable to boil with lime alone, which is believed to be
less injurious to delicate fibres than caustic soda. Dunbar<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>

<p class="noindent">These are all boiled at a pressure of from 20 to 25 lbs. for
10 hours, in stationary boilers without vomit, and also in
boilers revolving horizontally. In some mills, where the
best qualities of paper are made, iron boilers are objected
to, as small particles of oxide of iron are apt to become
dislodged from the interior of the boiler, and produce discolouration
of the paper. In such cases wooden vats,
with mechanical stirrers, are employed; sometimes a
jacketed boiler is used.</p>

<p><b>Washing and Breaking.</b>&mdash;The removal of the dirty
water resulting from the boiling is effected in the washing
and breaking engine, or "rag engine," as it is commonly
called, which is constructed on the same principle as the
beating engine, but is provided with an extra drum, called
the <em>drum-washer</em>, which, being covered with wire gauze,
allows the washing waters to escape without permitting
the fibrous stuff to pass through. The rag engine, having
been invented by a Dutchman, acquired, and still retains,
the name of the <em>Hollander</em>, and although it has been considerably
improved upon, its principle is still retained in
the modern engines, of which there are many different
forms. The ordinary rag engine, Figs. 11 and 12, consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of a cast-iron trough <span class="fs70">A</span>, about 10 feet long, 4½ feet wide, and
2½ feet deep, and rounded at the ends, and is firmly bolted
to a wooden foundation. It is provided with a partition
termed the <em>midfeather</em> <span class="fs70">B</span>, of such a length as to have the
trough of uniform width round it. A cylinder, or <em>roll</em>, <span class="fs70">C</span>,
furnished with a series of steel knives, rotates in one of
the divisions formed by the midfeather, and the floor of
the trough in this division is inclined in such a manner as
to cause the pulp, as it travels, to pass under the roll.
Beneath the roll is the <em>bed-plate</em>, which is fitted with a
series of steel knives <em>c c</em> similar to those on the exterior of
the roll. The distance between the knives of the roll and
the bed-plate is regulated by levelling screws, which are so
adjusted that both ends of the roll are raised at the same
time, which is a great improvement upon the older types
of breaking engines in which only one end of the roll was
raised, whereby the knives became unequally worn. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the present method of regulating the distance between the
respective sets of knives, any required degree of fineness
can be given to the fibrous substances treated. The roll
is generally caused to rotate at a speed of about 230
revolutions per minute, causing the water and rags to circulate
in the engine and to be constantly under the action
of the knives. In the other division <span class="fs70">F F</span> of the trough
is the drum-washer <span class="fs70">H</span>, which, being covered with fine
gauze wire, allows the water to enter, but keeps back the
fibrous material. The ends of the drum are formed of
two discs of wood, generally mahogany, upon which the
coarse gauze is fastened as a backing, and this is covered
with the fine wire gauze. The interior of the drum is
sometimes furnished with a series of buckets, which conduct
the water to a trough in the axis of the drum, by
which it is led away. This is also accomplished by dividing
the interior of the cylinder into compartments by means
of a partition. The drum-washer is so arranged that it
can be wholly raised out of the trough, which is necessary
in certain parts of the operation, when the removal of the
liquid is not required; or it can be partially raised, or
otherwise, according to requirement. The floor of the
compartment containing the roll <span class="fs70">C</span> is inclined at <span class="fs70">D</span>, so as
to cause the pulp to pass directly under the roll, and at
<span class="smcap">D′</span> is the <em>backfall</em>, over which the pulp travels to the opposite
side of the midfeather.</p>

<p>In working the rag engine, it is first partly filled
with water, and then set in motion; the boiled stuff is
then gradually put in, and a constant supply of clean
water is run in from a cistern provided with means of
preventing sand or other impurities from finding their
way into the engine. It is of the utmost importance that
the water should be abundant and of good quality, more
especially as the material (rags) is mostly required for
making the finer qualities of paper. In this respect the
county of Kent and a few other localities on the chalk
formation are considered specially suitable for this particular
manufacture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>With respect to the driving of the engines, this was
formerly effected by what is called <em>toothed gearing</em>, but
cog-wheels were afterwards replaced by iron spur-wheel
gearing, which enabled manufacturers to drive four or
more engines from one source of power, by continuing the
line of shafting and spur-wheels; but even with small
rolls the wear and tear on this system was considerable,
while it was quite inadequate to the driving of a number of
large rolls of 30 inches in diameter, such as are now used.
The introduction of belt-gearing, by Messrs. G. and W.
Bertram, proved to be a great improvement on the older
system, and it is found that the rags are broken not only
more uniformly, but in less time, as the rolls work more
steadily on the plates than with any system of wheel-gearing,
while the various working parts of the engine
last longer than when subjected to the vibrating action of
wheel-gearing.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 13.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Bertrams' Rag Engine.</b>&mdash;This engine, of which a
drawing is shown in Fig. 13, may be used either as a
washing and breaking engine, potcher, or beater. It is
provided with double lifting gear, and has "all sweeps,
curves, and angles" of the most improved design to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
lodgments and ensure steady and thorough travelling of
the pulp. The drum-washer is shown lifted by rack and
pinion and worm gear, and empties down the midfeather
direct to mouthpiece. The emptying can be done by
spout and pipe, or by a chamber cast on the engine, down
back or front side, as well as through the midfeather;
but it is not advisable that it should be emptied down the
midfeather if the rag engine is to be used as a beater.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 14.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Bentley and Jackson's Rag Engine.</b>&mdash;This form of
engine is shown in Fig. 14. The trough is of cast-iron,
and made whole, and the engine can be obtained of any
required dimensions. The trough is provided with a sand-well,
cast-iron grate, and cock in front of the roll, and a
sand-well, cast-iron grate, and brass valve on the back of
the midfeather, a brass let-off valve and a brass waste-water
valve. The bottom of the trough is "dished," to
prevent the stuff from lodging. There are two movable
bridge trees, fitted with pedestals and brass steps, and
wrought-iron lifting links and screws, worm-wheels,
worms, cross-shaft and hand-wheel for simultaneously
lifting the roll on both sides. The roll is covered by a
polished pitch-pine cover. The drum-washer may have
either iron or wooden ends, has strong copper brackets,
and is covered with brass backing and covering wires,
mounted on a wrought-iron shaft, and carried by cast-iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
stands, fitted with improved lifting gear, driving-wheels,
and pulley.</p>

<p>When the engine is set in motion by the revolving
shaft or spindle, the combined action of the knives of the
roll and bed-plate causes the rags, which circulate in the
water, to be gradually cut into small fragments, and the
operation is kept up until the rags are converted into what
is technically termed <em>half-stuff</em>. While this process is
going on, fresh water is constantly supplied by a pipe at
the end of the washing-engine; and when it is found that
nothing but clear water escapes from the drum-washer,
this is raised, and the spindle bearing the roll is lowered, so
as to bring the respective knives closer together, to enable
them to cut the reduced material still finer.</p>


<p><b>Draining.</b>&mdash;When the material is sufficiently <em>broken</em>, as
it is termed, the engine is then emptied by means of its
valves, and the contents run into large vats or <em>drainers</em>,
furnished with perforated zinc floors, in which it is
allowed to drain thoroughly; and in order to remove the
water more effectually, the pulp is afterwards pressed,
either by an extractor or a centrifugal drainer, which
dries it sufficiently for gas-bleaching, or for treatment in
the <em>potcher</em> or <em>poacher</em>. This is a larger engine than the
washer, and instead of the cylinder and bars, has a hollow
drum which carries on its periphery a number of cast-iron
paddles, which thoroughly agitate the pulp, and thus
render it more susceptible of being freely and uniformly
acted upon by the bleaching agent. The drum-washer of
this engine should have a finer wire than is used for the
breaker.</p>


<p><b>Torrance's Drainer.</b>&mdash;This machine, which has been
extensively used, is manufactured by Messrs. J. Bertram
and Son, of Edinburgh. It consists of a perforated cylindrical
box, enclosed in a fixed case, which revolves at
about two hundred and fifty revolutions per minute. The
machine is capable of treating about 4 cwt. of pulp per
hour.</p>

    </div>

<p class="noindent"><b>Preliminary Treatment: Picking.</b>&mdash;Esparto is imported
in bales or trusses, tightly compressed by hydraulic
presses, and bound with twisted bands of the same
material, much in the same manner as hay, except that
which comes from Tripoli, which is bound with iron
bands. The bands being cut, the loosened material is
then spread out upon tables, partly covered with iron,
or galvanised-iron, netting, to allow earthy matter or sand
to pass through to a receptacle beneath. Here it is carefully
picked by women and girls, who remove all roots,
other kinds of grass, weeds, and heather. The material
thus cleansed from impurities is transferred to the boiling-room.
This careful preliminary treatment has been
found necessary, since pieces of root and other vegetable
matters which may be present are liable to resist the action
of the bleaching liquor to a greater extent than the grass
itself, and therefore produce specks, or "sheave" as they
are termed at the mill, in the manufactured paper.</p>

<p>At some mills, however, as at the Horton Kirby Mills
of Messrs. Spalding and Hodge, at South Darenth, for
example, the cleaning of esparto is admirably effected by
means of a willow, or esparto-cleaner, constructed by
Messrs. Masson, Scott, and Bertram, which entirely
supersedes the system of hand-picking. Having recently
visited the mill referred to, we were enabled, through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
courtesy of Mr. Sydney Spalding, to witness the action of
this willow, which appeared to perform its functions with
perfect uniformity, and to clean the grass most effectually.
The <em>rationale</em> of the operation of willowing esparto may
be thus described:&mdash;</p>


<p><b>Willowing Esparto.</b>&mdash;A bale of the grass is unbound
at a short distance from the machine, and the grass,
which is in the form of small bundles or sheaves, tied
with bands of the same material, is thrown by a woman
on to a table or platform placed by the side of the
willow, and a second woman, standing near the hopper
of the machine, takes the bundles, a few at a time, and
drops them into the hopper. The machine being in
motion, in a few moments the grass, freed from its
bands and dirty matters, appears in a perfectly loose condition
at the wider end of the drum, and passes upward
along a travelling-table to a room above, in the floor of
which are the man-holes of a series of esparto boilers.
During the passage of the loosened fibre, women standing
on steps or platforms at the sides of the travelling-table are
enabled to examine the material, and to remove any objectionable
matters that may be present. Beneath the drum
of the machine is a pipe, through which the dust and
dirty matters are drawn away by means of a fan.</p>


<p><b>Boiling Esparto.</b>&mdash;In the boiling-room at the mill referred
to is a series of vertical stationary boilers, each about twenty
feet high, and capable of holding about three tons of grass.
The man-holes of these boilers pass through the floor of a
room above, being nearly level with it, into which the
cleaned esparto is conveyed, as described, by the travelling-table
of the willowing machine. In this room is a series
of compartments in which the willowed esparto is stored
until required for boiling, when it is fed into the boilers
by means of two-pronged forks provided for the purpose.
The boiler being partially charged with caustic ley at 14°
Twad., the esparto is introduced, and steam also, by which
the esparto becomes softened, and thus a larger quantity
of the fibre can be charged into the vessel. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
full charge of ley and esparto have been introduced the
head of the boiler is securely fixed by means of its bolts,
and steam then turned on until a pressure of about 20 lbs.
to the square inch has been reached, which pressure is
kept up for about three hours, when the steam is shut off
and the blow-off tap opened. When the steam is blown
off, the spent liquor is run off, and hot water then run
into the boiler, steam again turned on, and the boiling
kept up for about twenty minutes to half an hour, at the
end of which time the steam is shut off and the blow-pipe
opened. As soon as the steam has blown off, the washing
water is run off by the bottom pipe, and the grass allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to drain as thoroughly as possible. A door at the lower
end of the boiler is then opened, and the grass emptied
into trucks and conveyed to the washing-engines.</p>

<p><b>Sinclair's Esparto Boiler.</b>&mdash;Another form of boiler,
known as Sinclair's boiler, of the vertical cylindrical type,
is shown in Figs. 15 and 16. It is constructed on what is
termed the "vomiting" principle, but without the central
vomiting-pipes generally used, and is fitted with one or
more vomiting-pipes close to the side, two diametrically
opposite pipes being used by preference. Steam jet pipes,
with upwardly-directed nozzles, are fitted into the vomiting-pipes
at points a little above the bends, between the
vertical and horizontal parts. The liquid or ley thrown
up the vomiting-pipes by the action of the steam is delivered
from the upper ends of the pipes over a diaphragm
or plate fixed near the top of the boiler, and the liquid is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
retained at a certain depth on the diaphragm by a number
of small tubes fixed in it, and the liquid becomes well
heated by the steam before overflowing down the tubes,
which tubes also serve to distribute it uniformly over the
fibrous materials in the boiler. A casing is formed at the
bottom of the boiler, and in some cases extended more or
less up the sides, and is supplied with steam, which should
be superheated, or of high pressure. With this arrangement
the heat in the boiler is maintained without the
excessive condensation of steam and consequent dilution
and weakening of the liquors which occurs in ordinary
boilers. Figs. 15 and 16 are horizontal and vertical sections
of one form of this boiler. The boiler is made with
a vertical cylindrical shell, 1; with a flat top, 2; and flat
bottom, 3; and there is an inner or second bottom, 4; the
space between it and the bottom, 3, being for steam to
assist in heating the contents of the boiler. At a little
distance above the inner bottom, 4, there is the usual perforated
horizontal diaphragm, 5, down through which the
liquid or ley drains from the fibre. Two diametrically
opposite vertical vomiting-pipes, 6, are formed by the
attachment of curved plates to the cylindrical shell, 1, and
these vomiting-pipes, 6, have their upper ends above a
horizontal diaphragm, 7, attached by stays to the boiler
top, 2. This diaphragm is perforated, and short tubes, 8,
are fixed in the perforations so as to project upwards, by
which arrangement the liquid, rising up the vomiting-pipes,
6, lies on the diaphragm to the depth of the tubes, 8,
and overflows down through them all equally, so as to be
uniformly distributed over the materials in the boiler.
Steam jet nozzles, 9, are fitted in the lower parts of the
vomiting-pipes, being supplied with steam by pipes, 10,
from one of which a branch, 11, supplies steam to the
double bottom, 3, 4. The steam jets cause the liquid to
be drawn from under the perforated diaphragm, 5, and
thrown up the pipes, 6, whereby a constant circulation of
the liquid through the fibre is maintained. The liquors
are drawn off by the pipe, 15. In another form of boiler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Mr. Sinclair employs vomit-pipes formed of thin steel
plates riveted to opposite sides of the boiler, and the liquid
which drains through the perforated double bottom is
forced upward through the vomit-pipes to the perforated
plates above, through which it distributes over the material
in fine jets. The boiler is capable of holding from
2 to 3 tons of esparto, and under a pressure of from 40 to
50 lbs. the boiling occupies about two hours.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_045.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 17.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Roeckner's Boiler.</b>&mdash;This boiler, of which an illustration
of two in series is given in Fig. 17, has been extensively
adopted by paper manufacturers. It will be noticed
that the vomit-pipe <span class="fs70">A</span> is placed outside the boiler, and the
steam enters at the cock <span class="fs70">B</span>, forcing the liquor up the
vomit-pipe <span class="fs70">A</span> and distributing it over the esparto. A
pipe <span class="fs70">C</span> is used for heating the liquor by means of waste
steam at the commencement of the operation. The grass
is fed into the boiler at the opening <span class="fs70">D</span>. At <span class="fs70">E E</span> are gauges
for showing the height of the liquor in the boiler, <span class="fs70">F F F</span>
are pipes for the supply of steam, strong ley, and water,
and the door <span class="fs70">G</span> is for the discharge of the boiled grass.
Each boiler is capable of holding 3 tons of esparto, and
the boiling is completed in about two and a half hours, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a pressure of from 35 to 40 lbs. per square inch. It is
said that the boiler effects a saving both in time and the
amount of soda used.</p>


<p><b>Mallary's Process.</b>&mdash;By this process the inventor says
that he obtains the fibre in greater length, and gets rid of
the gummy and resinous matters in a more economical
way than by the present system. The materials used
form a species of soap, with which and with the addition
of water, the esparto is boiled. To carry out his process,
he places in a boiler a suitable quantity of water, to which
caustic soda, or a ley of the required strength to suit the
nature of the fibre, is added; magnesite, or carbonate of
magnesia, in the proportion of about 2 per cent. of the
fibrous material, or a solution of sulphate of magnesia, is
then added and mixed with the ley. He next adds "an
improved saponaceous compound" to produce the required
result, and when the boiling is completed, the stuff is
treated as ordinary stock, to be applied for paper-making
or other uses. The proportions are as follows:&mdash;2 gallons
of petroleum or its products, 1 gallon of mustard oil, 10 to
15 lbs. of caustic soda, and 1 per cent. of boracic acid.
These are placed in a copper and heated for 1 to 2 hours,
until properly saponified. From 3 to 6 gallons of the
"saponaceous compound" are added to the ley and magnesite,
previously placed in the boiler with the fibre, and
the boiling is kept up for the usual length of time, when
the fibre will be found "beautifully soft, and the greater
portion of the gum, silica, and resinous matters removed,
or so softened as to be no hindrance to the perfect separation
of the fibres, whilst the strength, silkiness, and softness
are preserved in all their natural integrity." Considering
that caustic soda ley "of the required strength"
forms an essential part of this process, we should imagine
that the auxiliaries mentioned would scarcely be necessary.</p>


<p><b>Carbonell's Process.</b>&mdash;In this process, devised by M.
Carbonell, of Paris, 200 lbs. of raw esparto are placed in a
wooden vat furnished with a perforated steam-pipe, 20 lbs.
of soda and 30 lbs. of quicklime being mixed with it:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the vat is then supplied with cold water until the esparto
is completely covered. Steam is then turned on, and the
materials boiled for 4 hours. The spent liquor is then
drained off, and the esparto submitted to hydraulic pressure.
It is afterwards washed and broken in a rag engine,
and in about 15 minutes is reduced to half-stuff. 20 lbs.
of chloride of lime dissolved in water are then introduced,
and the cylinder kept in motion as usual. In another
vessel, lined with lead, 1¼ lb. of sulphuric acid is dissolved
in 3 lbs. of water, and this gradually added to the pulp,
which immediately assumes a reddish colour; but in the
course of about three quarters of an hour it becomes
perfectly white, when the pulp is ready for the paper-maker.</p>

<p>In the boiling of esparto, several important points have
to be considered. The kind of esparto to be treated is the
first consideration, since this grass differs materially in
character in the different countries from which it is imported.
Spanish esparto is considered the best for paper-making,
as it is stronger in fibre and yields a whiter pulp
than other varieties. Of the African espartos there are
several varieties, which are known respectively as Oran,
Tripoli, Sfax, Gabes, and Susa. Of these, the first-named
(Algerian esparto) is held in highest estimation amongst
paper-makers, since it more closely resembles Spanish
esparto than the other varieties, though not so hard and
stiff as the latter. These grasses usually have a length of
about 10 to 12 inches. Tripoli esparto has an entirely
different growth, being sometimes as long as 2½ or 3 feet,
and proportionately stouter, and is also softer than Oran
esparto, which is not so hard as the Spanish variety.
Tripoli esparto does not yield a strong paper by itself, but
in conjunction with Oran esparto gives more favourable
results. Sfax and Gabes espartos have a closer resemblance
to Oran than Tripoli, but are not so strong as
Oran, being green and spongy, and not so dry as the
latter variety. Susa esparto of good quality is said to
equal Oran, but not to yield so high a percentage of fibre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The next important consideration is to determine the
percentage of caustic alkali which should be used per
hundredweight of the particular variety of esparto to be
treated, and we cannot do better than give the following
proportions recommended by Mr. Dunbar.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunbar says that the above figures "insure a first-class
boil, with the steam pressure of 25 lbs. and not
exceeding 30 lbs., but are liable to alteration according
to circumstances&mdash;such as the form of boilers, quality of
the water for boiling purposes, and steam facilities, which
ought at all times to be steady and uniform to get the
absolute regularity required."</p>

<p>Respecting the strength of caustic ley used for boiling
esparto, as indicated by Twaddell's hydrometer, this
appears to range from 7° to 15°, some preferring to boil
with stronger liquors than others. The time occupied in
boiling also varies at different mills, and depends greatly
upon the character of the boiler used. We are informed
that a Sinclair boiler will turn out, on an average, three
boils in twenty-four hours, including filling, boiling, discharging,
&amp;c., the boiling occupying about four hours for
each batch of grass.</p>

<p>The boiling being completed, the liquor is run off into
tanks, to be afterwards treated for the recovery of the
soda, and the esparto is then subjected to a second boiling
with water only for about 20 minutes. The liquor from
the second boiling is sometimes thrown away, even when
the soda from the first liquor is recovered; but a more
economical method is to use this liquor, in lieu of water,
strengthened with soda for a first boiling; or to mix it
with the first liquors and evaporate the whole together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
The second boiling being finished, the steam is turned off,
and water then run in and steam again turned on for a
short time, and the water then run off and the esparto
allowed to drain thoroughly. The boiled grass is then
discharged into trucks which convey it to the washing
engines.</p>

<p>The liquor resulting from the boiling of esparto, which
is of a dark brown colour, contains nearly all the soda
originally used, but it also contains silicious, resinous, and
other vegetable matters which it has dissolved out of the
grass, the silica taking the form of silicate of soda. The
esparto liquor, which was formerly allowed to run to
waste, polluting our rivers to a serious extent, is now
treated by several ingenious methods for the recovery of
the soda with considerable advantage alike to the manufacturer
and the public. The process consists essentially
in boiling down the liquor to dryness, and incinerating
the residue. During the process of incineration the carbonaceous
matter extracted from the grass is converted
into carbonic acid, which, combining with the soda, reconverts
it into carbonate of soda, which is afterwards
causticised with lime in the usual way, and the caustic
soda thus obtained is again used in the boiling of esparto.
Although one or other of the "recovery" processes is
adopted at a good many of our paper-mills, the recovery
of the soda is by no means universal as yet, but the time
will doubtless soon arrive when the economical advantages
of the process will be fully recognised. Indeed, we
know it to be the fact that some manufacturers are
watching, with keen interest, the progress of some of the
newer systems of soda recovery, with the full intention
eventually of adopting one or other of them.</p>


<p><b>Washing Boiled Esparto.</b>&mdash;This operation is usually
performed in engines similar to those used in washing
rags, but in some mills the boiled grass is washed in a
series of tanks, so arranged that water flows in at one
end of the series, thence passing in succession through
each batch of grass in the other tanks, and finally issues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
at the farthest end of the series as a very concentrated
liquor. By this arrangement there is great economy of
water, while at the same time no loss of fibre occurs.
The concentrated washing liquors thus obtained may be
evaporated, and the alkali recovered, which would be an
undoubted saving, since these liquors obtained in the
ordinary way by washing in the boilers are generally
run off as waste. The engines used for washing esparto
and converting it into half-stuff are generally of large
size, and capable of treating a ton of boiled esparto. In
this engine, however, there is no bed-plate, as the action
of the roll alone is sufficient to reduce the boiled and
softened esparto to half-stuff. A drum-washer is also
furnished to the engine, which carries off the dirty washing
water, while an equivalent proportion of clean water
is kept constantly running into the engine from an
elbowed pipe at its end. In charging the washing-engine,
it is first about three parts filled with water, when the
washing cylinder is lowered, and the esparto is then put
in, care being taken not to introduce more of the material
than will work freely under the action of the roll; if the
mass be too stiff, portions of the material may be imperfectly
washed. While the washing is in progress, the
workman, armed with a wooden paddle, constantly stirs
the esparto, clearing it away from the sides of the engine,
so that none of the material may escape a perfect washing.
At the bottom of the engine is a "sand-trap," covered
with perforated zinc, through which any sand or other
solid particles which may be present escape. When the
washing is complete, the fresh water supply is shut off,
and the drum-washer allowed to run until enough water
has been removed to make room for the bleaching liquor.</p>


<p><b>Young's Process.</b>&mdash;By this process the boiled and
strained esparto is passed through elastic covered rollers,
so adjusted as to split up and squeeze out the dissolved
matters or liquid from the fibres, thus leaving them clean
and open for the access of the bleaching liquor.</p>


<p><b>Bleaching the Esparto.</b>&mdash;It is usual to bleach esparto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in the washing engine, for which purpose a tank of bleaching
liquor of the required strength (about 6° T. for
Spanish) is placed close to the engine, which is provided
with a pipe leading to the engine and another pipe proceeding
from the tank in which the bleaching liquor is
stored. The supply tank is furnished inside with a gauge,
divided into inches&mdash;each inch representing so many
gallons of liquor&mdash;by means of which the workman is
enabled to regulate the quantity of bleaching liquor he is
instructed by the manager or foreman to introduce into
the engine. About half an hour after the bleach has
become well incorporated with the fibre, sulphuric acid
in the proportion of six ounces of the acid (which must be
well diluted with water) to each hundredweight of the
fibre. The dilute acid should be added gradually, and
the proportions given must not be exceeded. The bleaching
being completed, the half-stuff is next treated in a
machine termed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">presse-pâte</i>, which not only cleanses
the material from sand and dirt, but also separates all
knots and other imperfections from the fibre in a most
effectual and economical manner. Indeed, we were much
struck with the excellent working of this machine at
Messrs. Spalding and Hodge's mill, at South Darenth,
and the remarkably fine quality of the finished pulp
obtained through its agency. The presse-pâte was
formerly used in the preparation of pulp from straw, but
its advantages in the treatment of esparto are now fully
recognised. The apparatus and method of working it
may be thus briefly described:&mdash;</p>

<p>The machine is on the principle of the <em>wet end</em> of a
paper machine, and consists of several stone chests for
holding the bleached half-stuff, in which are fitted agitators
to keep the stuff in suitable condition. From these
chests the stuff is pumped into a mixing box, and from
thence over a series of sand traps made of wood, and with
slips of wood fixed in the bottom, in which any sand
present is retained. The stuff then passes into a series of
strainers, which, while allowing the clean fibre to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
through, retain all impurities, such as knots, &amp;c., and the
clean stuff is allowed to flow on to the wire-cloth in such a
quantity as to form a thick web of pulp. A greater
portion of the water escapes through the wire-cloth, but a
further portion is removed by the passage of the pulp
across two vacuum boxes, connected with four powerful
vacuum pumps, which renders the half-stuff sufficiently
dry to handle; but to render it still more so, it now passes
between couch rolls, and is either run into webs, or, as
is sometimes the case, it is discharged into boxes, the
web of pulp thus treated being about an inch in thickness.</p>

<p class="noindent">The advantages of wood fibre as a paper material have
been fully recognised in the United States and in many
Continental countries, but more especially in Norway,
Sweden, and Germany, from whence large quantities of
wood pulp are imported into this country. There is no
doubt that our home manufacturers have recently paid
much attention to this material, and it is highly probable
that wood, as an inexhaustible source of useful fibre, will
at no distant date hold a foremost rank. Indeed, the very
numerous processes which have been patented since the
Watt process was first made known, indicate that from this
unlimited source of fibre the requirements of the paper-maker
may be to a large extent satisfied, provided, of
course, that the processes for reducing the various suitable
woods to the condition of pulp can be economically and
satisfactorily effected. The great attention which this
material has received at the hands of the experimentalist
and chemist&mdash;the terms not being always synonymous&mdash;shows
that the field is considered an important one, as indeed
it is, and if successfully explored will, it is to be
hoped, yield commensurate advantages both to inventors
and the trade.</p>

<p>The object of the numerous inventors who have devised
processes for the disintegration of wood fibre&mdash;that is, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
separation of cellulose from the intercellular matters in
which the fibres are enveloped&mdash;has necessarily been to
dissolve out the latter without injury to the cellulose itself,
but it may be said that as yet the object has not been fully
attained by either of the processes which have been introduced.
To remove the cellular matter from the true fibre
or cellulose, without degrading or sacrificing a portion of
the latter, is by no means easy of accomplishment when
practised on an extensive scale, and many processes which
present apparent advantages in one direction are often
found to exhibit contrary results in another. The field,
however, is still an open one, and human ingenuity may
yet discover methods of separating wood fibre from its
surrounding tissues in a still more perfect manner than
hitherto.</p>

<p>The various processes for treating wood for the extraction
of its fibre have been classified into: (1) chemical processes;
and (2) mechanical processes. We will give precedence to
the former in describing the various wood pulp processes,
since the pulp produced by the latter, although extensively
used, is chiefly employed, in combination with other pulps,
for common kinds of paper. In reference to this part of
our subject Davis says:&mdash;"Experience has dictated certain
improvements in some of the details of those earlier
methods, by which so-called 'chemical wood pulp' is
manufactured very largely on the Continent of Europe....
It is possible to obtain a pulp of good quality, suitable
for some classes of paper, by boiling the chipped wood
in caustic soda, but when it is desired to use the pulp so
prepared for papers having a perfectly white colour it has
been demonstrated in practice that the action of the caustic
soda solution at the high temperature which is required
develops results to a certain degree in weakening and
browning the fibres, and during the past five years much
labour has been expended in the endeavour to overcome
the objections named. The outcome of these efforts has
been a number of patents, having for their object to prevent
oxidation and subsequent weakening of the fibres."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
In several of these patents, to which we shall refer hereafter,
bisulphite of lime is employed as the agent to prevent
oxidation and consequent degradation of the fibres,
and in other processes bisulphite of magnesia has been
used for the same purpose. Davis further remarks:
"Although a common principle runs through all these
methods of preparing cellulose from wood, they differ in
detail, as in the construction of the digesters employed,
methods of treating the wood stock before boiling it in
the sulphurous acid solution, and also as regards pressure,
blowing off the sulphurous acid gas, etc., but all these processes
present a striking similarity to the method patented
by Tilghmann in 1867." There can be no doubt that the
action of caustic soda, under high pressures, is highly injurious
both to the colour and strength of the fibres, and
any process that will check this destructive action in a
thoroughly practical way will effect an important desideratum.</p>


<p><b>I. Chemical Processes</b>: <em>Watt and Burgess's Process</em>.&mdash;This
process, which, with some modifications, is extensively
worked in America, consists in boiling wood shavings,
or other similar vegetable matter, in caustic soda ley, and
then washing to remove the alkali; the wood is next
treated with chlorine gas, or an oxygeneous compound of
chlorine, in a suitable vessel, and it is afterwards washed
to free it from the hydrochloric acid formed. It is now
treated with a small quantity of caustic soda in solution,
which instantly converts it into pulp, which only requires
to be washed and bleached, and beaten for an hour and a
half in the beating engine, when the pulp is ready for the
machine. The wood-paper process as carried out in
America has been described by Hofmann, from whose work<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
we have abridged the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The wood, mostly poplar, is brought to the works in
5-feet lengths. The bark having been stripped off by
hand, it is cut into ½-inch slices by a cutter which consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of four steel knives, from 8 to 10 inches wide by 12 to 15
inches long, which are fastened in a slightly inclined position
to a solid cast-iron disc of about 5 to 7 feet diameter,
which revolves at a high speed, chopping the wood&mdash;which
is fed to the blades through a trough&mdash;into thin slices
across the grain. The trough must be large enough to
receive the logs, usually 10 or 12 inches thick, and it is
set at such an angle that the logs may slide down towards
the revolving cutters; this slanting position only assists
the movement of the logs, while a piston, which is propelled
by a rack, pushes them steadily forward until they
are entirely cut up. The piston, or <em>pusher</em>, then returns to
its original position, fresh wood is put into the trough, and
the operation repeated. In this way many tons of wood
can be chopped up by one of these cutters in a day. The
sliced wood is conveyed by trucks to an elevator by which
it is hoisted up two storeys to a floor from which the boilers
are filled. The boilers are upright cylinders, about 5 feet
in diameter and 16 feet high, with semi-spherical ends,
provided inside with straight perforated diaphragms, between
which the chips from one cord of wood are confined.
A solution of caustic soda, at 12° B., is introduced with
the chips, and fires are started in a furnace underneath.
At other works the boilers are heated by steam
circulating through a jacket which covers the bottom and
sides of the boiler.</p>

<p>The boiling is continued for about six hours, when the
digestion is complete, and the contents of the boilers are
emptied with violence, under the pressure of at least 65 lbs.
of steam, which had been maintained inside. A large slide
valve is attached to the side of each boiler for this purpose
close to the perforated diaphragm, and connected by a
capacious pipe with a sheet-iron cylinder of about 12 feet
diameter and 10 feet high, which receives the contents&mdash;pulp,
liquor, and steam. The object of these large chambers&mdash;one
of which serves for two boilers&mdash;is to break the
force of the discharging mass. The steam passes through
a pipe on the top of each, and from thence through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
water reservoir, while the liquid containing the pulp flows
through a side opening and short pipe into movable boxes,
or drainers, mounted on wheels, and each capable of holding
the contents of one boiler; these boxes are pushed
along a tramway up to the collecting chambers, where the
pulp is received. In a building 132 feet long and 75 feet
wide, ten digesting boilers are arranged in one straight
line, and parallel with the boilers runs the main line of
rails, side tracks extending from it to each of the chambers,
and a turn-table is supplied at every junction. By this
arrangement the drainer waggons can be pushed from the
side tracks on to the main line, which leads to the washing-engines
in an adjoining room. A system of drainage is
established below the tramways, by which all the liquid
which drains from the waggons is carried away and collected
for treatment by evaporation; these carriers remain
on the side tracks until the pulp is ready for the washing-engine.</p>

<p>When the greater portion of the liquor has drained
off, warm water is sprinkled over the pulp from a hose
for the purpose of extracting all the liquid which is sufficiently
concentrated to repay the cost of evaporation&mdash;the
most advantageous method of recovering the soda.
The contents of the waggons&mdash;from the same number of
boilers&mdash;are then placed in two washing-engines, each
capable of holding 1,000 lbs. of pulp. After being sufficiently
worked in these engines the pulp is transferred to
two stuff-chests, and from thence conveyed by pumps to
two wet-machines. The screens (strainers) of the wet-machines
retain all impurities derived from knots, bark,
and other sources, and the pulp, or half-stuff, obtained
is perfectly clean and of a light grey colour. The pulp is
bleached with solution of bleaching powder like rags, then
emptied into drainers and allowed to remain therein with
the liquid for twenty-four to forty-eight hours, or long
enough to render the use of vitriol in the bleaching unnecessary.
The portion of the white pulp which is to be
worked up into paper in the adjoining mill is taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the drainers into boxes running on tramways in the moist
state, but all the pulp which has to be shipped to a distance
is made into rolls on a large cylinder paper-machine
with many dryers. The object being merely to dry the
pulp, a very heavy web can be obtained, since the water
leaves this pulp very freely. The wood pulp thus obtained
is perfectly clean, of a soft, white spongy fibre, and a
greater portion of it is mixed with a small proportion of
rag pulp and worked into book and fine printing papers.
Sometimes the wood pulp is used alone or mixed with
white paper shavings for book paper. The fibres are
rather deficient in strength, but as a material for blotting
paper they are said to be unsurpassed, while the wood
paper is much liked by printers.</p>

<p>The wood from poplar, which is generally preferred,
furnishes a very white fibre, and is easily digested, but
since the fibres are short it is sometimes found advantageous
to mix them with longer fibres, as those of the
spruce or pine, although the latter wood requires a much
more severe treatment in boiling with alkali than the
former. In reference to this process the following remarks
appeared in <cite>The Chemist</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> 1855:&mdash;"The process
occupies only a few hours; in fact, a piece of wood may
be converted into paper and printed upon within twenty-four
hours." An interesting verification of this was
published a few years since in an American paper, the
<cite>Southern Trade Gazette</cite>, of Kentucky, which runs as follows:&mdash;"At
a wood-pulp mill at Augusta, Ga., a tree was
cut down in the forest at six o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, was made into
pulp, and then into paper, at six o'clock in the evening,
and distributed amongst the people as a newspaper by six
o'clock the next morning. From a tree to a newspaper,
being read by thousands, in the brief round of twenty-four
hours!" The wood-paper process referred to has given
rise to many subsequent modifications, some of which we
will briefly describe.</p>


<p><b>Sinclair's Process.</b>&mdash;The wood is first cut into pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
about 1 inch broad, ⅛th inch thick, and from 2 to 3 inches
long. It is then placed in a boiler and a solution of caustic
soda, in the proportions of 600 gallons to 10 cwts. of
dry wood, is poured over it. The boiler having been securely
closed, the heat is raised till a pressure of 180 to
200 lbs. on the square inch is obtained, when the fire is
withdrawn and the boiler allowed to cool, after which the ley
is blown off, the top door removed, and the contents scalded.
The discharge door is now opened and the pulp transferred
to a poaching-engine to be washed with pure water, when
the resin, &amp;c., are easily removed and the clean fibres obtained,
which, it is said, are longer and firmer than those
obtained by other methods.</p>


<p><b>Keegan's Process.</b>&mdash;By this method soft deal or pine is
sawn up into pieces from 6 to 12 inches long and ½ inch
thick, it being preferable that all the pieces should be of
an equal size, but the smaller they are the more rapid, of
course, will be the operation. The pieces of timber are
placed in a cylindrical boiler, turning upon a horizontal
axis while the digestion is progressing. In a second
boiler is prepared a solution of caustic soda of about
20° B. (specific gravity 1·161), which is introduced
through a pipe into the first boiler, this being afterwards
hermetically closed, and the soda is forced into the pores
of the wood by means of a pump. When the wood is not
more than half an inch in thickness a pressure of 50 lbs.
on the square inch is sufficient, and the injection of the
caustic soda solution is completed in half an hour. The
superabundant liquor is pumped back into the second
boiler for the next operation. The excess of liquor
having been removed from the wood as stated, steam is
introduced between the double sides of the first boiler, and
the temperature of the wood raised from 150° to 190° C.
(334° to 438° F.). The wood is next washed in the
usual way until the liquor runs off perfectly limpid, and
the half-stuff thus produced may be converted into pulp
either before or after bleaching, according to the quality
and colour of the paper to be produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<p><b>American Wood-Pulp System.</b>&mdash;Another method of
carrying out the wood-pulp process has recently been described
by Mr. E. A. Congdon, Ph.B.,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> from which we
extract the following:&mdash;"Poplar, pine, spruce, and occasionally
birch, are used in the manufacture of chemical
fibre. Pine and spruce give a longer and tougher fibre
than poplar and birch, but are somewhat harder to treat,
requiring more soda and bleach. Sticks of poplar, freed
from bark, and cleansed from incrusting matter and dirt,
are reduced to chips by a special machine having a heavy
iron revolving disc set with knives, and are then blown by
means of a Sturtevant blower into large stove chambers after
passing over a set of sieves having 1¼-inch for the coarse
and 1⅛-inch mesh for the fine sieves, from whence they
pass to the digesters, which are upright boilers 7 by
27 feet, with a manhole at the top for charging the chips
and liquor, and a blow-valve at the bottom for the exit of
the boiled wood. A steam-pipe enters at the bottom, beneath
a perforated diaphragm, and keeps the liquor in perfect
circulation during the boiling of the wood by means
of a steam-ejector of special construction."</p>

<p><em>Boiling.</em>&mdash;The average charge of wood for each digester
is 4·33 cords,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> giving an average yield of 4,140 lbs. of
finished fibre per digester. A charge of 3,400 gallons
of caustic soda solution of 11° B. is given to each digester
charged with chips, and the manhead is then placed
in position and steam turned on. Charging the digester
occupies from thirty to forty-five minutes, and steam
is introduced until the gauge indicates a pressure of
110 lbs., which occupies about three hours. This pressure
is kept up for seven hours, when it is reduced by
allowing the steam to escape into a large iron tank which
acts as a separating chamber for the spent liquor it carries,
the steam entering in at one end and passing out at the
other through a large pipe, the liquor remaining in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>tank. The steam is allowed to escape until the pressure
is reduced to 45 lbs., when the digester is blown. The
blow-cap being removed, the blow-valve is raised and the
contents of the digester are discharged into a pan of iron
covered with a suitable hood. The contents strike against
a dash-plate placed midway in the pan, which thoroughly
separates the fibres of the wood. The time occupied in the
foregoing operations is from eleven to eleven and a half
hours. It takes from nine to ten hours to free the pans
from alkali, when they are removed to washing-tanks with
perforated metal bottoms, where the material receives a
final washing before being bleached.</p>

<p><em>Washing.</em>&mdash;Each of the three digesters has a pan into
which its contents are discharged, and there are also four
iron tanks used for holding the liquors of various strengths
obtained from the cleansing of the pulp and a fifth tank
is kept as the separating-tank before mentioned. When
the digester is blown, the pulp is levelled down with a
shovel, and the liquor from the separating-tank is allowed
to flow into it. The contents of the next strongest pan
are pumped upon it, while at the same time the strongest
store tank flows into this pan. This flowing from the tank
to the pan, pumping from here to the pan just blown, and
from there to the evaporators, is kept up until the liquor
is not weaker than 6° B. hot (130° F.). The second pan
is now down to 4° B. hot, and the process of "pumping
back" is commenced. The two weakest tanks are put
upon this pan and pumped out of the bottom of it into the
two tanks in which are kept the strongest liquors. The
two weak tanks have been filled in the process of completing
the cleansing of the third pan (the weakest) on which
water was pumped until the last weak tank stood at only
½° B. This pan, now cleaned, is hosed and pumped over
to the washing tanks. A fresh blow is now made in
this pan, and the same treatment kept up as with the
first pan.</p>

<p>The foregoing system is thus illustrated by Mr.
Congdon:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="fs70">A</span> is levelled down; contents of separating-tank allowed
to flow upon it; <span class="fs70">B</span> is pumped on to <span class="fs70">A</span>; at the same time
liquor from the two strong store tanks is put on it (<span class="fs70">B</span>), and
this continued to be sent from <span class="fs70">A</span> to the evaporator until it
is now weaker than 4° B. hot; the process of "pumping
back" is then commenced. The two weakest are allowed
in succession to flow on to it, and the liquor purified from
the bottom of <span class="fs70">B</span> into the two strong tanks, filling No. 1,
the stronger, before No. 2. The weakest are filled in the

now hosed and pumped over to the washing tanks. A
fresh digester is blown in <span class="fs70">C</span>, and the process repeated as
with <span class="fs70">A</span>.</p>

<p>The above system has been modified by having an
extra pan into which the liquor from the last pan blown
(after sending to the evaporators until down to 6° hot, and
bringing down to 4° hot, by the stored liquor) is pumped.
When the strength is reduced to 4° the pumping is
stopped. The liquor from this pan is put in the next pan
blown, after the liquor from the separating-tank has been
put upon it, whereby an economy in time is effected.</p>

<p>The pulp, after being partially cleaned in the pans,
still contains an appreciable quantity of soda. It is hosed
over to the washing-tanks and receives a final washing
with hot water. When the pulp is thoroughly free from
alkali, and the water flowing from under the tank is
colourless, the contents are hosed down by hot water into
the bleaching-tanks. The superfluous water is removed
by revolving washers, and about 1,000 gallons of a solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of chloride of lime at 4° B. are then introduced, and
the contents agitated as usual. The bleaching occupies
about six or seven hours, when the pulp is pumped into
draining tanks, where it is left to drain down hard, the
spent bleach flowing away. The stock is then hosed and
pumped into a washing-tank, where it acquires the proper
consistency for the machine. From here it is pumped into
the stuff chest, whence it goes over a set of screens and on
to the machine, from which the finished fibre is run off on
spindles. The rolls are made of a convenient size to
handle, averaging about 100 lbs. each. The fibre is dried
on the machine by passing over a series of iron cylinders
heated by steam. The finished product is a heavy white
sheet, somewhat resembling blotting paper. The whole
of the foregoing operations are stated to occupy forty-five
hours.</p>


<p><b>Aussedat's Process.</b>&mdash;By this method the wood is disintegrated
by the action of jets of vapour. In one end of
a cylindrical high-pressure boiler, about 4½ feet in diameter
and 10 feet high, is fixed a false bottom, whereby the
wood placed upon it may be removed from the liquor resulting
from steam condensed in the chamber, the whole being
mounted on lateral bearings which serve for the introduction
of the vapour, and the wood is fed through a manhole
at the upper end of the boiler. Taps are fixed at the
upper and lower ends for the liquid and uncondensed
vapour. The wood having been placed in the boiler, the
jet is gradually turned on in such a way that at the end of
three or four hours the temperature becomes about 150° C.,
the pressure being about five atmospheres, which point is
maintained for an hour. As the slightest contact between
the wood and the condensed water would at once discolour
the former, it is essential that the liquid be removed from
time to time by one of the outlets provided for the purpose.</p>

<p>The treatment above described is said to be suitable for
all kinds of wood, and although it is the usual practice to
introduce it in logs about a yard long, any waste wood, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
chips, shavings, etc., may be used. It is preferable, though
not necessary, to remove the bark, but all rotten wood
may be left, as it becomes removed in the condensed water.
The logs, after the above treatment, by which the fibre is
disintegrated and the sap and all matters of a gummy or
resinous nature are removed, are afterwards cut up by any
suitable means into discs of about an inch, according to
the nature of the fibre required. These are then introduced
into a breaker, in which they become converted into
half-stuff, which, after being mixed with a suitable quantity
of water is passed through mills provided with conical
stones, in which it becomes reduced to whole-stuff. The
pulp thus prepared is principally used in the manufacture
of the best kinds of cardboard, but more particularly such
as is used by artists, since its light brownish shade is said
to improve the tone of the colours. Bourdillat says that
in the above process the vapour has a chemical as well as
a mechanical action, for in addition to the vapour traversing
the cellular tissues of the wood and dissolving a considerable
portion of the cell-constituents, acetic acid is
liberated by the heat, which assists the vapour in its action
on the internal substance of the wood.</p>


<p><b>Acid Treatment of Wood.</b>&mdash;A series of processes have
been introduced from time to time, the object of which is
to effect the disintegration of wood fibre by the action of
acids. The first of these "acid processes" was devised by
Tilghmann in 1866, in which he employed a solution of
sulphurous acid; the process does not appear to have been
successful, however, and was subsequently abandoned, the
same inventor having found that certain acid sulphites
could be used more advantageously. Other processes have
since been introduced, in which wood is treated in a direct
way by the action of strong oxidising acids, as nitric and
nitro-hydrochloric acids, by which the intercellular matters
of the wood become dissolved and the cellulose left in a
fibrous condition.</p>


<p><b>Pictet and Brélaz's Process.</b>&mdash;By this process wood is
subjected to the action of a vacuum, and also to that of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
supersaturated solution of sulphurous acid at a temperature
not exceeding 212° F. In carrying out the process a
solution of sulphurous acid is used, consisting of, say from
⅕ to ⅓ lb. avoirdupois of sulphurous acid to each quart of
water, and employed under a pressure of from three to six
atmospheres at 212° F. Under these conditions the
cementing substances of the wood "retain their chemical
character without a trace of decomposition of a nature to
show carbonisation, while the liquor completely permeates
the wood and dissolves out all the cementing constituents
that envelop the fibres." In carrying out the process
practically, the wood is first cut into small pieces as usual
and charged into a digester of such strength as will resist
the necessary pressure, the interior of which must be lined
with lead. Water is then admitted into the vessel and
afterwards sulphurous acid, from a suitable receiver in
which it is stored in a liquid form until the proportion of
acid has reached that before named, that is, from 100 to 150
quarts of the acid to 1,000 quarts of water. The volume
of the bath will be determined by the absorbing capacity
of the wood, and is preferably so regulated as not to materially
exceed that capacity. In practice it is preferable to
form a partial vacuum in the digester, by which the pores
of the wood are opened, when it will be in a condition to
more readily absorb the solution and thereby accelerate the
process of disintegration. When disintegration is effected,
which generally occurs in from twelve to twenty-four
hours, according to the nature of the wood under treatment,
the liquor, which is usually not quite spent in one
operation, is transferred to another digester, a sufficient
quantity of water and acid being added to complete the
charge. In order to remove the liquor absorbed by the
wood, the latter is compressed, the digester being connected
with a gas-receiver, into which the free gas escapes and
in which it is collected for use again in subsequent operations.
The bath is heated and kept at a temperature of
from 177° to 194° F. by means of a coil in the digester
supplied with steam from a suitable generator. The wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
after disintegration, undergoes the usual treatment to convert
it into paper pulp, and may thus be readily bleached
by means of chloride of lime. The unaltered by-products
contained in the bath may be recovered and treated for use
in the arts by well-known methods.</p>


<p><b>Barre and Blondel's Process</b> consists in digesting the
wood for twenty-four hours in 50 per cent. nitric acid,
used cold, by which it is converted into a soft fibrous
mass. This is next boiled for some hours in water and
afterwards in a solution of carbonate of soda; it is then
bleached in the usual way.</p>


<p><b>Poncharac's Process.</b>&mdash;In this process cold nitro-hydrochloric
acid (aqua regia) is employed for disintegrating
wood in the proportions of 94 parts of the latter to 6 parts
of nitric acid, the mixture being made in earthen vessels
capable of holding 175 gallons. The wood is allowed to
soak in the acid mixture for six to twelve hours. 132 lbs.
of aqua regia are required for 220 lbs. of wood. When it
is desired to operate with a hot liquid, 6 parts of hydrochloric
acid, 4 parts of nitric acid, and 240 parts of water
are used in granite tubs provided with a double bottom,
and it is heated by steam for twelve hours and then
washed and crushed.</p>


<p><b>Young and Pettigrew's Process.</b>&mdash;These inventors use
either nitric or nitrous acids, and the acid fumes which
are liberated are condensed and reconverted into nitric
acid.</p>


<p><b>Fridet and Matussière's Process.</b>&mdash;This process, which
was patented in France in 1865, consists in treating wood
with nitro-hydrochloric acid, for which purpose a mixture
of 5 to 40 per cent. of nitric acid and 60 to 95 per cent.
of hydrochloric acid is used, which destroys all the ligneous
or intercellular matter without attacking the cellulose.
After the wood (or straw) has been steeped in the acid
mixture, the superfluity is drawn off, and the remaining
solid portion is ground under vertically revolving millstones.
The brownish-coloured pulp thus obtained is
afterwards washed and bleached in the usual way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>It is quite true that cellulose can be obtained from wood
and other vegetable substances by treatment with nitric acid
alone, or with a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids,
but it will be readily seen that the employment of such
large quantities of these acids as would be required to
effect the object in view on a practical scale, would be
fraught with incalculable difficulties, amongst which may
be mentioned the insuperable difficulty of obtaining vessels
that would resist the powerful corrosive action of the
acids. Moreover, since nitric acid forms with cellulose an
explosive substance (<em>xyloidin</em>) of the gun cotton series, the
risk involved in the drying of the cellulose obtained would
be quite sufficient to forbid the use of processes of this
nature.</p>

    </div>


<p class="noindent"><b>Sulphite Processes.</b>&mdash;An important and successful
method of treating wood has been found in employing
sulphurous acid, combined in certain proportions with
soda, lime, or magnesia, whereby a bisulphite of the alkaline
or earthy base is obtained. One of the principal
attributes of these agents is that in boiling wood at high
pressures oxidation and consequent browning of the fibres
is prevented. Of these sulphite, or more properly bisulphite,
processes, several of those referred to below have
been very extensively adopted, and vast quantities of so-called
"sulphite pulp" are imported into this country
from Norway, Germany, Scandinavia, &amp;c., the product
from the latter source being considered specially suited
for the English market. Some of these processes are also
being worked in this country, but more particularly those
of Partington, McDougall, and Ekman.</p>


<p><b>Francke's Process.</b>&mdash;In this process, which is known
as the "bisulphite process," the active agent employed for
the disintegration of wood is an acid sulphite of an alkaline
or earthy base, as soda or potassa, lime, &amp;c., but it is
scarcely necessary to say that the process has since
been modified by others. The invention is applicable
to the treatment of wood, esparto, straw, etc., and may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
be thus briefly described:&mdash;A solvent is first prepared,
which is an acid sulphite of an alkali or earth, that is, a
solution of such sulphite with an excess of sulphurous acid.
As the cheapest and most accessible base the inventor
prefers lime. It has long been known that a solution of
sulphite of lime, combined with free sulphurous acid,
would, at a high temperature, dissolve the intercellular
portions of vegetable fibres, leaving the fibres in a suitable
condition for paper manufacture; but Mr. Francke claims
to have determined the conditions under which this can
be effected with rapidity, and in such a way as to preserve
the strength of the fibres, and to have obtained a practical
method of preparing pulp by his process. For his purpose
he employs a moderately strong solution of the solvent at
a high temperature, with gentle but constant agitation.
The acid sulphite is produced by this process at small cost
and at a temperature nearly high enough for use in the
following way:&mdash;A tower or column is charged with fragments
of limestone, which are kept wetted with a shower
of water; fumes of sulphurous acid, produced by burning
sulphur, or by roasting pyrites, etc., are then passed through
the tower. The liquid which collects at the bottom of the
tower is the desired solvent, which should have a strength
of 4° to 5° B. It is not essential that the limestone should
be pure, as magnesian limestone, etc., will answer equally
well. The soluble alkalies, as soda and potassa, may also
be used when their greater cost is not an objection. But
for these alkalies the treatment is modified, as follows:&mdash;The
tower is charged with inert porous material, such as
coke, bricks, etc., and these are kept wetted by a shower
of caustic alkali at 1° to 2° B., while the sulphurous acid
fumes are passed through the tower. In like manner carbonate
of soda or potassa may be used, but in this case the
solution showered on the porous material should be stronger
than that of the caustic alkali, so that it may contain approximately
the same amount of real alkali. Whichever
alkaline base be employed, the liquid collected at the bottom
of the tower should have a strength of 4° to 5° B.;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
this being the acid sulphite of the base is used as the solvent
employed for the manufacture of pulp. When wood
is to be treated, it is freed as much as possible from resinous
knots by boring and cutting them out, and is then
cut&mdash;by preference obliquely&mdash;into chips of a ¼ to ¾ of an
inch thick. Esparto, straw, and analogous fibres are cut
into fragments. The fibrous material and solvent are
charged into a digester heated by steam at a pressure of
four or five atmospheres, and consequently capable of raising
the temperature of the contents to about 300° F.
As agitation greatly promotes the pulping of the materials,
Mr. Francke employs a revolving cylindrical boiler, which
is allowed to revolve while the charge is under treatment.</p>


<p><b>Ekman's Process.</b>&mdash;In this process, which in some
respects bears a resemblance to the preceding, native carbonate
of magnesia (magnesite) is first calcined to convert
it into magnesia; it is then placed in towers lined with
lead, and sulphurous acid gas, obtained by the burning of
sulphur in suitable furnaces, is passed through the mass,
a stream of water being allowed to trickle down from the
top of the towers. The supply of gas is so regulated that
a continual formation of a solution of bisulphite of magnesium,
of an uniform strength, is obtained; great care,
however, is necessary to avoid excess and consequent loss
of sulphurous acid by its conversion into sulphuric acid.
In boiling, the fragments of wood, previously crushed by
heavy rollers, are placed in a jacketed, lead-lined, cylindrical
boiler, suspended on trunnions, so that it can be
inverted to remove the charge. The pressure in the outer
jacket is 70 lbs. per square inch, and that within the
boiler is 90 lbs. per square inch. The boiling occupies
twelve hours. This process has been extensively worked
by the Bergvik and Ala Company, of Sweden, for many
years with great success, and we understand that the company
has been turned over to an English company&mdash;the
Bergvik Company, Limited. The Ilford Mill and Northfleet
Works have been largely supplied with sulphite pulp
from the Swedish works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>One great drawback to the bisulphite processes is that the
boiling cannot be effected in iron boilers unless these be
lined with some material which will protect the iron from
the destructive action of the bisulphite, which, being an
acid salt, would exert more action upon the iron than upon
the fibre itself, and the solution of iron thus formed would
inevitably prove injurious to the colour of the fibre. In
several of the systems adopted iron boilers lined with lead
have been used, but the heavy cost of this material and
its liability to expand unequally with the iron, especially
at the high temperatures which the solvent necessarily
attains under pressure, causes the lead to separate from
the iron, while it is apt to bulge out in places, and thus
becomes liable to crack and allow the acid liquor to find
its way to the interior of the iron boiler which it was
destined to protect. To overcome this objection to the
simple lead lining, Dr. Mitscherlich patented a process
which has been extensively adopted in Germany, and is
now being carried out by several companies in different
parts of America. This process is briefly described below.</p>


<p><b>Dr. Mitscherlich's Process.</b>&mdash;The digester employed
in this process is lined with thin sheet lead, which is
cemented to the inner surface of the boiler by a cement
composed of common tar and pitch, and the lead lining is
then faced with glazed porcelain bricks. In this process a
weaker bisulphite of lime is used than in Francke's, and
the time of boiling is consequently considerably prolonged.</p>


<p><b>Ritter and Kellner</b> have proposed to unite the inner
surface of the boiler to its lead lining by interposing a
soft metal alloy, fusible at a temperature lower than that
of either metal, and it is claimed that the iron and lead
are thus securely united, while the alloy being fusible
under the normal working temperature of the digester,
the lead lining can slide freely on a boiler shell.</p>


<p><b>Partington's Process.</b>&mdash;This process, which has been
for some time at work at Barrow, and for the further development
of which a private company, entitled the Hull
Chemical Wood Pulp Company, Limited, has been formed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
consists in the employment of sulphite of lime as the disintegrating
agent. The process consists in passing gaseous
sulphurous acid&mdash;formed by burning sulphur in a retort,
into which is forced a current of air at a pressure of 5 lbs.
to the square inch&mdash;through a series of three vessels, connected
by pipes, the vessels being charged with milk of
lime. The first two of these vessels are closed air-tight,
and the gas is then introduced, while the third vessel
remains open; from this latter a continuous stream of
nitrogen escapes, due to the removal of the oxygen by the
burning sulphur from the air passed into the retort. This
process is said to be a very economical one, so far as
relates to the cost of materials used.</p>


<p><b>Blitz's Process.</b>&mdash;This process consists of employing a
mixture composed of bisulphite of soda 2 parts, caustic
soda 1 part; and vanadate of ammonia 1 gramme, in hydrochloric
acid 4 grammes to every 6 kilogrammes of the
bisulphite. The wood, after being cut up in the ordinary
way, is submitted to the action of the above mixture,
under a pressure of three or four atmospheres, for from
four to eight hours, and the pulp is then ground; it is said
to possess some of the qualities of rag pulp and to look
much like it.</p>


<p><b>McDougall's Boiler for Acid Processes.</b>&mdash;This invention
is intended to obviate the difficulties which arise
in using lead-lined boilers, owing to the unequal expansion
and contraction of the lead and the iron on their being
alternately heated by steam and cooled, on the discharge
of each successive batch of pulp. This invention consists
in constructing the boilers with an intermediate packing
of felt, or other compressible and elastic material, so that
when the interior leaden vessel is heated, and thereby
enlarged and pressed outwards by the steam, the compressible
and elastic packing yields to the pressure and
expansion. Also in the cooling of the vessels the packing
responds to the contraction, and approximates to its original
bulk and pressure between the two vessels, and so
prevents the rupture or tearing of the lead and consequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
leakage and other inconveniences. Another part of this
invention consists in the construction of the outer iron or
steel vessel in flanged sections, which are fitted to incase
the interior leaden vessel with a space between the two
vessels, into which the compressible and elastic materials
are packed. In the construction of these vessels the iron
or steel flanged sections are placed on to the leaden vessel
and packed with the compressible and elastic lining in
succession. As each section is packed it is screwed close
up to the adjoining section by the screw bolts, fitted into
corresponding holes in the flanges of the contiguous section
until completed. This method of construction secures
economy by the retention of the heat, which is effected by
the packing between the two vessels. The materials used
for the packing are caoutchouc, felt, flocks, asbestos, etc.,
and a space of about two inches between the vessels is preferred,
into which the packing is filled.</p>


<p><b>Graham's Process.</b>&mdash;This process consists in boiling
fibrous substances in a solution of sulphurous acid, or a
sulphite or bisulphite of soda, potash, magnesia, or lime,
or other suitable base and water. The boiling is preferable
conducted in a closed boiler, lined with lead, to protect it
from the action of the chemical substances used, and is
fitted with a valve which can be opened to allow the gases
and volatile hydrocarbons contained in and around the
fibres to escape. The method of carrying out the process
has been thus described:&mdash;"In carrying out the process
there is a constant loss of sulphurous acid gas going on,
and consequently a continual weakening of the solution
employed, to avoid which it is preferable to employ monosulphite
of potash, soda, magnesia, lime, or other suitable
base, and water. Either of these substances, or a suitable
combination of them, and water are placed in the boiler
with the fibrous substances to be treated, and the temperature
raised to the boiling point. After the hydrocarbons,
air, and gases natural to the fibrous substances have been
driven out by the heat and allowed to escape, sulphurous
acid, in its gaseous or liquid state, or in combination with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
either of the bases referred to, is pumped or injected into
the boiler. There is thus forming in the closed boiler a
solution containing an excess of sulphurous acid above that
required to form, in combination with the base, a monosulphite.
The operation of injecting sulphurous acids, or
the sulphites, may be repeated from time to time during
the boiling, so as to fully maintain, and if necessary increase,
the strength and efficiency of the chemical solution.
It is said that by this process a saving of the
chemicals employed is effected, as little or no sulphurous
acid gas is lost during the time the gaseous hydrocarbons,
air, and other gaseous matters are being expelled from
the fibrous materials. If an open vessel is used instead
of a closed boiler, it will be necessary to keep the solution
at a fairly uniform strength, and if necessary to
increase the strength, but the result will be substantially
the same; but as it is evident that, when using an
open boiler, the excess of sulphurous acid supplied during
the boiling will be constantly driven off as gas, it must be
replaced by further injections, while the acid fumes may
be conveyed away and condensed, so as to be available for
further use. When the fibrous substances are boiled as
above, with the addition of potash, soda, etc., during the
boiling, the result will be equally beneficial. The inventor
prefers to inject the sulphurous acid or its combinations
into the boiler at the bottom, and to cause it to come in
contact with the solution therein before reaching the
fibrous materials. For this purpose there is formed a kind
of chamber beneath the boiler, but separated from it by a
perforated disc or diaphragm of lead or other suitable
material not acted upon by the solution, so as to allow the
latter to fill the chamber, to which is connected a pipe,
through which the sulphurous acid or solutions of the sulphites
is forced by any suitable apparatus.</p>


<p><b>Objections to the Acid or Bisulphite Processes.</b>&mdash;While
the various methods of boiling wood in caustic
soda at high temperatures are well known to be open to
serious objections, the acid treatment of wood also presents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
many disadvantages, which it is to be hoped may be yet
overcome. In reference to this, Davis makes the following
observations:&mdash;"In the acid treatment of wood for the
purpose of converting the fibres into pulp for use in
paper manufacture, the general practice has been to use
alkaline solutions of soda, combined in various proportions
with certain acids, such, for instance, as sulphurous acid,
hydrochloric acid, etc. These solutions have been heated
in digesting vessels, and the high temperature resulting
from this process of heating developing a pressure of
from six to seven atmospheres, the wood being disintegrated
by the action of the boiling solutions, the gum,
resinous constituents, and other incrustating or cementing
substances that bind the fibres together are decomposed,
destroyed, or dissolved, while pure cellulose, which constitutes
the essential element of the ligneous fibres, is
separated therefrom. To this end high temperatures had
to be employed, otherwise the disintegration was found
to be only partial, the wood remaining in a condition
unfit for further treatment. The high temperature not
unfrequently converts a large proportion of the resinous
and gummy constituents of the wood into tar and pitch&mdash;that
is to say, carbonaceous bodies that penetrate into the
fibre and render its bleaching difficult, laborious, and
costly, while the frequent washing and lixiviation necessary
to bleach such products seriously affect the strength of
the fibre and its whiteness, and also materially reduce the
percentage of the product, in some instances to the extent
of 18 per cent. These difficulties and detrimental results
materially enhance the cost of production, while the fibre
itself suffers considerably in strength from the repeated
action of the chloride of lime.... The difficulties are
chiefly due to the carbonisation of certain constituent
parts of the fibres under temperatures exceeding 212°
F., such carbonised matters being insoluble and incapable
of being bleached, and as they permeate the fibre,
cannot be entirely removed.</p>

<p>"To overcome these difficulties, the wood should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
chemically treated at a temperature sufficiently low to
ensure that the decomposition of the connecting substances
of the fibres will remain chemically combined with the
other elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen,
in order to obtain an increased product of superior
quality and render the process more economical."</p>


<p><b>Sulphite Fibre and Resin.</b>&mdash;A German manufacturer
sent the following communication to the <cite>Papier Zeitung</cite>,
which may be interesting to the users of sulphite pulp:&mdash;"In
making [disintegrating] cellulose by the soda or sulphite
process, the object in boiling is to loosen the incrusting
particles in the wood, resin included, and to liberate
the fibres. The resin is dissolved both in the soda and
sulphite processes, but in the former it is at the same
time saponified, and is consequently very easily washed
out. In the case of sulphite fibre, however, the resin
attaches itself by its own adhesiveness to the fibres, but
can also be removed by as hot washing as possible, and
adding a little hydrochloric acid, which produces a very
great effect. At the same time, however, sulphite fibre
loses in whiteness by thorough washing, and assumes a
reddish-grey shade. As the paper manufacturer insists
upon white fibre, the manufacturer of sulphite fibre not
only often omits washing, but adds some sulphite solution
(bisulphite of lime). This not only enables him
to give his customers white fibre, but he also sells a
quantity of the incrusting particles and sulphite residuum
as cellulose.</p>

<p>"So long as the manufacturer looks more to white than
to well-washed cellulose, or does not wash it well before
working up the fibre, these annoyances cannot be avoided.
Not only this, but other disadvantages will be added in
the course of time, as the action of the sulphurous acid in
the pulp will have very injurious consequences on metals&mdash;[and
on the fibre itself?] especially iron&mdash;coming in
contact with it. This should be the more avoided, as the
whiteness of the unwashed cellulose is of very short
duration. The paper made from it soon turns yellow and
becomes brittle. Well-washed sulphite fibre, on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
hand&mdash;provided no mistakes have been made in the boiling
process&mdash;makes a strong, grippy paper, which can
withstand both air and sunlight. I have made no special
studies as to resin, but believe that pine and fir act differently,
especially with solvents."</p>


<p><b>Adamson's Process.</b>&mdash;Mr. W. Adamson, of Philadelphia,
obtained a patent in 1871 for the use of hydrocarbons
in the treatment of wood. His process consisted
in treating the wood with benzine in closed vessels, under
a pressure of 5 to 10 lbs., according to the nature of the
wood. His digester consisted of an upright cylinder, in
which the wood-shavings were placed between two perforated
diaphragms. The mass was heated beneath the
lower diaphragm by a coil through which steam was
passed. The vapours which were given off were allowed
to escape through a pipe on the top of the digester, to
which was connected a coil immersed in a vessel of cold
water, and the condensed liquid then returned to the
lower part of the digester. The remaining portion of the
benzine in the digester, which was still liquid but
saturated with the extracted matters, was drawn off
through a faucet at the bottom. Benzine being a very
cheap article in America, a similar process was recommended
in another patent by the same author for extraction
of pitch and tar from rags [tarpaulin, ropes, &amp;c.?],
and for removing oil from rags and cotton waste.</p>


<p><b>Sulphide Processes.</b>&mdash;Many attempts were made about
thirty years ago, and in subsequent years, to employ the
soluble sulphides as a substitute for caustic soda in
boiling wood and other fibres, but these processes do not
appear to have been very successful. Later improvements
in the construction of boilers or digesters, however, seem
to have induced further experiments in this direction, and
we understand that several sulphide processes are being
worked on the Continent, the processes of MM. Dahl and
Blitz being amongst them. One of the supposed advantages
of these sulphides over caustic soda is that by
evaporation and calcination of the liquors, or leys, by
which the organic matters become destroyed, the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
product would be recovered, which merely requires to be
dissolved out for further use. There are, however, several
important objections to the use of sulphides in this way,
amongst which may be mentioned the deleterious vapours
which they emit; and this alone would doubtless prevent
their employment&mdash;at all events in this country.</p>


<p><b>II. Mechanical Processes.</b>&mdash;Besides the various chemical
methods of separating cellulose from woody fibres,
before described, certain processes have been devised for
reducing wood to the condition of pulp directly by mechanical
means without the aid of any chemical substance
whatsoever. In this direction Heinrich Voelter, of Wurtemburg,
appears to have been the first to introduce a
really practical process for the conversion of wood into
pulp for paper-making, although, as far back as 1756, Dr.
Schaeffer, of Bavaria, proposed to make paper from sawdust
and shavings mechanically formed into pulp: the process
was not successful, however, with the machinery
then at his command.</p>


<p><b>Voelter's Process for Preparing Mechanical Wood
Pulp.</b>&mdash;In 1860-65 and 1873 Voelter obtained patents
in this country for his methods of treating wood mechanically,
and the process may be thus briefly described:&mdash;Blocks
of wood, after the knots have been cut out by
suitable tools, are pressed against a revolving grindstone,
which reduces the material to a more or less fine condition,
but not in a powdery form, and the disintegrated
fibre is caused to press against a wire screen, which allows
the finer particles to pass through, retaining the coarser
particles for further treatment.</p>

<p class="right">[<em>To face page 78.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The apparatus employed, which is shown in Fig.
17<span class="fs70">A</span>, consists of a pulping apparatus <span class="fs70">A</span>, with vat <span class="fs70">K</span>, in
which the revolving stone <span class="fs70">S</span> is placed; the blocks of
wood are held against the stone at <em>p p</em>, and water is
introduced at <span class="fs70">G</span>, and the revolving stone carries the
pulp against the screen <span class="fs70">E</span>, which admits the passage
of the finer particles of the wood, while the coarser
particles are led by the trough <span class="fs70">F</span> to the first refining
cylinder <span class="fs70">B</span>, after passing through an oscillating basket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
which retains the coarser particles. From thence it is led
through a distributing apparatus and hopper <span class="fs70">C</span>, to be uniformly
supplied to the refining cylinder <span class="fs70">D</span>, these cylinders
being of the ordinary construction, and, as usual, covered
with fine gauze wire sieves. The ground material which
fails to pass through the sieves is transferred by an elevator
to the millstones <span class="fs70">E</span>, which are of ordinary construction,
and after leaving these unites with the finer fibres which
pass through <span class="fs70">E</span>, the whole now entering a mixing reservoir
<span class="fs70">F</span>, whence it is thrown on to the cylinder <span class="fs70">G</span>, and the pulp
which passes into this is distributed on to a similar cylinder
<span class="fs70">H</span>, the contents of which then passes through the last
cylinder <span class="fs70">I</span>, which is differently constructed to the others,
inasmuch as its lower part is surrounded by an impervious
leather jacket, so that the pulp ascends in order to
enter it. The disintegrated fibres that are retained by the
wires of the cylinders pass into the refiners, which consist
of a pair of horizontal cylinders of sandstone, one of
which (the upper one) only revolves, and by the action of
these the coarser fibres become further reduced, the finer
particles, as before, passing through the wire gauze of the
cylinders, the operation being repeated in the same order
until the whole of the fibres have passed through the sieves.</p>


<p><b>Thune's Process.</b>&mdash;Mr. A. L. Thune, of Christiana,
U.S.A., has recently patented an apparatus for disintegrating
wood, which consists of a grinding apparatus
connected to a turbine. In this arrangement the grindstone,
fixed on a shaft, is worked by a turbine, and the
wood, which is used in small blocks, is pressed against
the stone by means of a series of hydraulic presses.
The fine pulp is afterwards made into thick sheets by
means of a board-machine, the pulp, mixed with water,
passing down a shoot into a vat beneath, in which is a
revolving cylinder covered with wire-cloth, which in its
revolution carries with it a certain quantity of pulp in a
continuous sheet; this is taken on to an endless travelling
belt by means of a small couch-roll, and passes on to a
pair of rolls, round the upper one of which the sheet becomes
wound, and is removed when sufficiently thick.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Treatment of Straw.</b>&mdash;As a paper-making material, the
employment of straw is of very early date, a patent for
producing paper from straw having been taken out by
Matthias Koops as far back as 1801. The material, however,
was used in its unbleached state, and formed a very
ugly paper. White paper was not obtained from straw
until 1841, but no really practical method of treating this
material was devised until about ten years later, in France,
when MM. Coupier and Mellier introduced a process
which, with subsequent modifications, has been extensively
adopted. A great advance in the manufacture of
paper from straw has since been effected by the introduction
of various boilers, specially constructed for boiling
the material at high pressures, and for keeping the alkaline
liquors freely circulated amongst the fibre during the
progress of the boiling. These boilers are of different
forms&mdash;being either cylindrical or spherical&mdash;and are preferably
of the revolving type, which causes the caustic ley
employed in the boiling to become uniformly mixed
with the fibre. Sometimes the vomiting boilers described
elsewhere are used by paper-makers in preference to those
referred to.</p>


<p><b>Bentley and Jackson's Boiler.</b>&mdash;This boiler, a representation
of which is shown in Fig. 18, is 7 feet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
diameter, 18 feet long on the cylindrical surface, with
hemispherical ends of Martin-Siemens steel plate 7/16 inch
thick in the shell, and ½ inch thick in the ends. It is
double riveted in the longitudinal seams, has two manholes
3 × 2, forged out of solid steel plate. Inside are
two perforated lifting plates or shelves, each 1 foot wide,
¼ inch thick, the full length of the shell, and secured to
the ends by strong angle-irons; it is supported on two
turned cast-iron trunnions. These boilers are tested by
hydraulic pressure to 120 lbs. per square inch.</p>

</div>

<p>The varieties of straw generally used for paper-making
in this country are wheat and oats, though rye and barley
straws are also used, but in a lesser degree. The treatment
of straw differs greatly at different mills, some
makers using strong liquors and boiling at a lower pressure,
while others prefer to use less caustic soda and boil
at a higher pressure. There can be little doubt, however,
that the high temperatures resulting from boiling at very
high steam pressure must deteriorate the fibre considerably,
causing subsequent loss of fibre in the processes of
washing and bleaching.</p>

<p><b>Boiling the Straw.</b>&mdash;The straw is first cut into short
lengths of one or two inches by means of a chaff-cutter,
or by a machine similar to a rag-cutter, and the cut
material is then driven by an air-blast through a wooden
tube into a chamber having coarse wire-gauze sides: a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
second chamber surrounds this, in which the dust from
the straw collects as it passes through the wire gauze.
The winnowed straw, freed from dust and dirt, is then
conveyed in sacks to the boilers. In charging the boilers,
a certain quantity of ley is first introduced, and steam
also, and the cut straw then added, which soon becomes
softened, and sinks to the bottom of the boiler, when
further quantities of the material are added, until the full
charge has been given. The requisite proportion of ley
and water is then run in and the head of the boiler secured
in its place. Steam is now turned on, until a pressure of
20 to 40 lbs., or even more, has been reached, when the
boiling is kept up for 3½ to 8 hours, according to the
pressure used and the strength of the alkaline liquor,
which varies from 9° to 16° Tw. From 10 to 20 lbs.
of caustic soda per cwt. of straw are generally required
to boil the material thoroughly. The boiling being
complete, steam is turned off, and when the boiler has
somewhat cooled, the material, which is in the form of
a pulp, is discharged by the pipes beneath into a large
tank or strainer, the bottom of which is fitted with
a series of plates having long narrow openings or slits,
through which the liquor drains. The pulp is then
washed with water, and again allowed to drain thoroughly,
after which it is dug out and transferred to the potcher to
be again washed and bleached. At some mills the straw
is boiled whole and not subjected to any preliminary cutting
In such cases the boiled straw, not being so fully
pulped as when cut into short lengths, is emptied from
the boiler through the manholes used for charging the
material into the boiler.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_083.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 19.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Bertrams' Edge-runner.</b>&mdash;For the purpose of crushing
the knots of the straw, and other hard particles derived
from weeds, etc., a machine termed the "koller-gang"
or "edge-runner" is sometimes employed. This
machine, which is manufactured by Bertrams, Limited,
and of which an illustration is given in Fig. 19, consists
of two large millstones, made from hard red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
granite, the surfaces of which are sometimes grooved
with V-shaped equidistant grooves. These stones are
worked by a horizontal spindle, and are caused to revolve
very rapidly in an iron basin, in which the washed
pulp is placed, and by this means the knots and harder
portions of the fibre not fully acted upon by the caustic
alkali, become so reduced as to be more readily accessible
to the action of the bleach, and thus a very superior
straw pulp is produced. In using this machine in the
way indicated, the washed pulp is mixed in a chest provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
with agitators, with water, is then pumped into a
second chest above it, from whence it flows into the basin
shown in the engraving, while the stones are revolving.</p>


<p><b>M. A. C. Mellier's Process.</b>&mdash;By this method the straw
is first cut into small lengths as usual; it is then steeped
for a few hours in hot water, and afterwards placed by
preference in a jacketed boiler, the object being to heat
the materials without weakening the ley by the direct
introduction of steam into the body of the material. The
boiler is to be heated to a pressure of 70 lbs. to the square
inch, or to a temperature of about 310° F., by which
means, it is said, a considerable saving of alkali is effected,
as also time and fuel, as compared with the ordinary practice
of boiling. The alkaline ley which M. Mellier prefers
to use is from 2° to 3° B., or of the specific gravity of
from 1·013 to 1·020, and in the proportion of about 70
gallons of such solution to each cwt. of straw. The boiler
should revolve very slowly, making about 1 or 2 revolutions
per minute. The boiling occupies about 3 hours,
at the pressure named, when the steam is turned off and
cold water passed through the jacket of the boiler, which
assists in cooling the pulp, the water thus used being
afterwards employed in washing the pulp. The pulp is
then thoroughly washed until the last water runs off quite
clear, when it is next steeped for about an hour in hot
water acidulated with sulphuric acid, in the proportion of
about 2 per cent. of the weight of the fibre. The pulp is
then washed with cold water, when it is ready for bleaching
in the usual way.</p>


<p><b>Manilla, Jute, etc.</b>&mdash;Previous to boiling these fibres it
is usual to cut them into short pieces by a machine such
as is used for cutting straw, after which they are cleaned
in a willowing and dusting machine. The boiling is then
conducted in the same way as for esparto. Manilla fibre
is not so much used in this country as in the United
States, where its employment forms an important feature
in the manufacture of certain kinds of paper. Some idea
of the extent to which it is used by the paper-makers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
America may be gleaned from the following statement of
Mr. Wyatt:&mdash;"Another large and important branch of
the American paper trade are the mills running on news
and Manilla paper. Many of these mills turn out a vast
quantity of paper, running up to two hundred tons per
week, besides making their own ground wood pulp.
The American news is composed mainly of ground wood
pulp, with an admixture of about 15 to 25 per cent.
of sulphite wood or jute fibre, and not much loading,
and the machines are run at high speed. What is termed
Manilla paper is very largely used in the States, and much
more so than with us for common writings, envelopes, and
wrapping papers. The paper is composed of Manilla,
jute fibre, old papers, etc., and is highly finished at the
machine. I was told of one mill belonging to a large
company running altogether six mills on news and
Manilla, turning out, with one 96-inch machine and beater
capacity of 1,800 lbs., and one Jordan, 10 to 12 tons of
2,000 lbs., of Manilla paper per day at an average speed
of 200 feet per minute."</p>

<p>Jute is seldom reduced to the condition of a fine white
pulp since the treatment necessary to obtain that condition
would result in a weak fibre; it is usual, therefore,
to only partially reduce the material, when a strong fibre
is obtained, which, lacking in whiteness, is used for coarse
papers. This also applies to Adamsonia, or Baobab,
another description of bast obtained from the West Coast
of Africa. These fibres are chiefly used for papers which
require strength rather than whiteness of colour, such as
wrapping papers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Broke" paper is a term applied to paper which has
been imperfectly formed on the paper machine or damaged
while passing over the drying cylinders. Imperfect sheets
when they are not sold as <em>retree</em>, and clean waste paper,
also come under this designation and are re-converted
into pulp after undergoing the treatment described below.</p>


<p><b>Waste Paper.</b>&mdash;In treating waste paper for conversion
into pulp for paper-making, it is doubtless advisable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
separate, as far as can be done economically, papers which
have been written upon with common ink, as old letters,
documents, &amp;c., from printed papers, since the latter
require a more severe treatment than the former. While
simple boiling in water containing a little soda-ash will
discharge ordinary writing ink, printer's ink can only be
extracted by using rather strong solutions of soda-ash or
caustic soda; and even with this treatment it can only be
rendered serviceable for an inferior paper, owing to the
grey colour of the resulting pulp, due to the carbon of the
printer's ink, upon which the alkali has no solvent effect.</p>


<p><b>Boiling Waste Paper.</b>&mdash;This is sometimes effected in
iron vats, about 8 feet deep and 8 feet in diameter at the
bottom, and about 6 inches wider at the top. At the
bottom of each vat is a false bottom, closely perforated
with small holes. Steam is introduced by a pipe below
the false bottom, which passes through the perforations
and thus becomes uniformly distributed to all parts of the
vat. To facilitate the emptying of the vats, the false
bottoms have connected to them three or four iron rods,
to the tops of which iron chains are hooked, and by this
means the false bottom, carrying the mass of boiled paper
can be raised by a steam hoisting engine or crane and
deposited where desired. When the boiling is commenced,
the vat should first be about one-fourth filled with a solution
of soda-ash, and the steam then turned on. When
the liquor boils, the papers having been previously dusted,
are introduced gradually, and well distributed through
the liquor; if they are thrown into the vat in large quantities
at a time, and especially if they are in a compact
state, the portions in contact may not be reached by the
liquor, and an imperfect boiling will be the result. To ensure
a uniform distribution of the boiling liquor over the
surface of the material, an iron pipe extends from the centre
of the false bottom to nearly the top of the vat, and this
pipe is covered with a hood, which causes the soda liquor
to be evenly spread over the whole mass. The vats are
either cased with wood or coated with asbestos to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the escape of heat, and the vessel is covered with a flat
iron cover, which is generally in two halves. The steam
enters the tubs at the side, below the false bottom, and
the exhausted liquor is drawn off through a valve connected
to the bottom of the vat. In some mills the liquor
is not drawn off after each boiling, but the boiled paper
is hoisted from the vat as before described, and the liquor
strengthened by the addition of from 10 to 20 lbs. of
soda-ash for each 100 lbs. of the paper to be next boiled.
Paper that is thickly coated with printing ink requires an
extra dose of soda-ash. The boiling is continued for twelve
to twenty-four hours according to the nature and condition
of the waste paper under treatment.</p>

<p>Waste papers are frequently boiled, after dusting, in
revolving boilers, in a solution of soda-ash or caustic soda,
but it not unfrequently happens that some portions of
the material become so agglomerated or half pulped during
the boiling that the alkali fails to reach all the ink, and
as this cannot be removed by the after processes of washing
and breaking, it remains in the body of the pulp and
necessarily forms a constituent part of the paper to be
produced from it. The mass, when discharged from the
boiler and drained is then conveyed to the washing-engine,
in which it becomes broken and freed from alkali and so
much of the ink as may have been dissolved or loosened,
and it is afterwards treated in the beater and mixed with
varying portions of other paper stock, according to the
quality of paper to be produced. In some mills the boiled
waste paper is disintegrated after boiling, by means of the
edge-runner (Fig. 19).</p>


<p><b>Ryan's Process for Treating Waste Paper.</b>&mdash;The following
process for treating waste paper so as to produce a
"first-class clean paper" therefrom, was patented by Mr.
J. T. Ryan, of Ohio. The waste paper is first passed
through a duster in the usual way, all thick old books
being previously torn apart to separate the leaves. The
papers are then boiled in a hot alkaline liquor without
pulping them, whereby the alkali acts on the surfaces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the papers, and dissolves off, carrying away all the ink
into the liquor. The papers, which are still in sheet form,
are then drained as free as convenient from the alkaline
liquor, and are next washed in the washing-engine, which
leaves the material perfectly clean. It is then pulped in
the beating-engine; and it is claimed that it can be
formed into first-class paper without the addition of any
new or expensive paper stock. The details of the process
are thus given by the patentee: "Into a bucking-keir put
a soda-ash solution having a density of 5° B., at 160° F.,
put in the stock, and shower for eight hours at a
temperature of 160° F., without pulping the paper,
then lift and drain, and cleanse well in the washing-engine;
then pulp and form into paper. As the draining
will always be imperfect, each charge removed will carry
away some of the soda-ash solution, and leave the remainder
of impaired strength. After each drainage add
water to make up for loss in quantity of the solution, and
add enough soda-ash solution at a density of 13° B.,
to bring all the liquor up to 5° B. at 160° F. In about
eighteen working days the liquor will have accumulated
considerable ink and other matter. Then blow
one half of the liquor, and restore the quantity for
proper working. None of the soda-ash solution is wasted,
except such as falls to drain and what is blown out as last
mentioned." In carrying out this process every care
must be taken to guard against pulping before the alkali
is washed out.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Bleaching Operation.</b>&mdash;The half-stuff treated in the
breaking-engine is run into the potcher, and the water it
contains is lifted out as far as practicable by the washer;
the spent liquor from the presses or drainers is then run
in in lieu of water, and as much fresh bleaching liquor as
may be required is then measured in, and in from two to
six hours the pulp becomes perfectly white. "However
well managed a mill may be," says Mr. Arnot, "it is
scarcely possible to avoid having a small residue of unused
chlorine in the liquid which drains from the bleaching
stuff." The rule, therefore, is to use this liquor in the
way above indicated, by which the unexhausted chlorine,
operating upon fresh half-stuff, becomes available, and is,
therefore, not wasted. "That as little of this residual
chlorine as possible may remain in the stuff," Mr. Arnot
further observes, "when put into the beating-engine,
powerful hydraulic presses are employed to compress the
stuff and squeeze out the liquid. These presses should be
large enough to contain easily the whole contents of a
poaching-engine, and of unexceptional workmanship. The
perforated lining especially should be carefully prepared
and properly secured. I have seen much trouble from
negligent workmanship in this respect. Recently I examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
a number of samples of press drainings, and
found the unexhausted chlorine to vary very much&mdash;from
a few grains of bleaching powder per gallon to about one
ounce."</p>

<p>Sometimes it is the practice to partly fill the potcher
with water, and the engine being set in motion, the half-stuff
is gradually introduced until the full charge has
been given, and the stuff is then washed for some time,
after which the drum-washer is raised, and the bleaching
liquor then run in, care being taken that the necessary
quantity is not exceeded, otherwise the fibre will suffer
injury from the chemical action of the bleaching agent.
When vitriol is employed to liberate the hypochlorous
acid, the vitriol, previously diluted with water, should be
placed in a small lead-lined tank in such a position that
the acid liquor may slowly trickle into the engine at the
rate of 1 lb. of sulphuric acid in twenty minutes. As
soon as the bleaching is complete the stuff is emptied into
large stone chests, each of which will hold the contents of
two engines. On the bottom of these chests are perforated
zinc drainers, while a similar drainer runs up the back of
each chest. The bleached stuff is allowed to remain as
long as may be convenient in these chests, after which it
is removed to the beating or refining engines. In some
mills the bleaching is effected in the breaking-engine,
while at other mills the operation is performed in the
beating-engine.</p>

<p>In bleaching it is considered to be more advantageous
to employ moderately strong liquors rather than weaker
ones, inasmuch as the object is effected in less time than
when weaker liquors are employed. An extreme in the
opposite direction, however, must be avoided, since a very
strong bleach will inevitably cause injury to the fibre.
Sometimes the potchers are fitted with steam-pipes, in
order that the diluted bleaching liquor may be heated, if
required, to facilitate the operation. If the temperature
be raised too high, however, the effect upon the fibre will
be at least as injurious as if too strong a bleach were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
employed. It must also be borne in mind that in either
case, after the pulp has been bleached and the liquor
allowed to run off, the mass has to remain some time&mdash;even
if pressed to remove as much of the liquor as possible&mdash;in
direct contact with the products resulting from the
decomposition, and probably some undecomposed hypochlorite
also, which will continue their chemical action
upon the fibre until removed by washing, or neutralised
by one or other of the agents employed for the purpose.</p>


<p><b>Sour Bleaching.</b>&mdash;When the bleaching liquor, after
acting upon the half-stuff for some time, has become
partially exhausted, dilute sulphuric acid&mdash;about one part
acid to fifteen parts of water&mdash;is added, which, by liberating
hypochlorous acid, hastens the bleaching considerably, and
when the chemical action resulting from this treatment is
nearly complete, the spent liquor is allowed to drain away,
and fresh bleaching liquor is introduced, the strength
being regulated by the progress made in the first case,
which will depend upon the character of the fibre treated.
In the second application of the bleach no acid is used.
When sulphuric acid is added to the bleaching liquor, as
above, the process is termed <em>sour bleaching</em>. Sometimes
hydrochloric acid is used for this purpose, but in either
case it is necessary to avoid employing the acid in too
concentrated a state, or in too great a quantity, otherwise
free chlorine will be liberated, which, besides being injurious
to the health of the workmen and the surrounding
machinery, also involves loss, while the colour and strength
of the fibre itself will also be impaired. In some mills
the bleaching is effected in the beating-engine, the bleaching
liquor being pumped in while the machine is in
motion.</p>

<p>Respecting the time which the bleaching operation
should occupy, there appears to be some difference of
opinion, or, at all events, the practice seems to vary in
different mills, but there is, no doubt, an advantage, so
far as ultimate yield is concerned, in moderately slow
bleaching at a moderate temperature, inasmuch as there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
is less risk of chemical action upon the cellulose itself
than when strong liquors are used, at a higher temperature,
with a view to hasten the operation and economise
the bleaching powder.</p>

<p><b>Bleaching with Chloride of Lime</b> (<em>Preparation of the
Bleaching Liquor</em>).&mdash;Chloride of lime, or hypochlorite of
lime, commonly called bleaching powder, when well prepared,
contains from 32 to 35 per cent. of active chlorine.
Being readily decomposed by the air, and also by heat,
this substance should always be stored in a cool and dry
place until required for use. A solution of bleaching
powder is generally prepared in large tanks lined with
lead, which are provided with agitators or stirrers, so
that the powder, when added to the water, may be freely
diffused, and its active material dissolved in the liquid.
A machine, or "bleach-mixer," manufactured by Messrs.
Bryan Donkin and Co., of Bermondsey, is shown in
Fig. 20, which is so constructed that the strong bleach
liquor does not destroy it. The device for agitating
the contents of the tank explains the principle of the
machine. To prepare the bleaching liquor, about ½ lb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of chloride of lime to each gallon of water is used,
which yields a liquor at about 6° T. When the required
quantity of bleaching powder and water have
been introduced into the mixer and sufficiently agitated,
the vessel is allowed to rest until the residue, which chiefly
consists of free lime and its carbonate, has subsided, when
the clear liquor may be run off for use. When all the
clear liquor has been drawn off the residue should be
washed with water, and after again settling, the washing
water run off, and fresh water added, these washings
being repeated as often as necessary to remove the
last traces of the "bleach," as it is technically called.
The washing waters may be used in lieu of water in the
preparation of fresh bleaching liquors. In some mills
the bleaching powder is mixed with from 2 to 3 times its
weight of water; the mixture is then well agitated and
the residue afterwards allowed to settle, the clear solution
being afterwards drawn off and the residue then washed
as before. In either case the residual matter is afterwards
well drained and then cast aside. The bleaching liquor is
stored in large tanks ready for use, from which it is withdrawn
as required by means of a syphon or otherwise.</p>


<p><b>Bleaching with Chlorine Gas</b> (<em>Glaser's Process</em>).&mdash;This
method of bleaching is not so much adopted in England as
formerly, but has found much favour in Germany; indeed,
within the past few years, namely, in March 3rd,
1880, a process was introduced by Mr. F. Carl Glaser for
treating straw, in which, after boiling with caustic soda as
usual, the pulp is bleached by the action of chlorine gas.
The straw, after being separated from weeds by a slight
or superficial picking, is cut into pieces of from ⅓ to
⅔ of an inch in length. The cut straw is then placed in
a rotary boiler for about four hours, at a pressure of about
4 to 4½ atmospheres, in a solution composed of 29 lbs.
of caustic soda at 71°, and 48 lbs. of calcined soda at 90°,
rendered caustic, for every 220 lbs. of straw. After boiling,
the dirty ley is drawn off, and the boiled straw subjected
to two washings with water. It is then conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to the washing-engine, where it is washed for an hour;
the drum of the machine should have a sieve or sifter, the
apertures of which are about 60 to the square inch. The
washed straw is next dried by centrifugal force in a hydro-extractor,
until it contains about 70 per cent. of water,
which is necessary for the action of the chlorine gas. To
effect this, so as to obtain not very solid or close cakes of
straw, the holes of the wire of the hydro-extractor should
not be more than 50 to the square inch. The cakes of
straw thus formed are then exposed to the action of
chlorine in leaden chambers of the ordinary kind, in which
they are placed in layers upon hurdles, or upon shelves.
If the chlorine is produced by hydrochloric acid, for every
220 lbs. of unboiled straw, 51½ lbs. of the acid at 20° B.,
and a corresponding quantity of 70 per cent. peroxide of
manganese are used. After the bleaching operation, the
acid formed is removed by washing in a washing-engine.
If a complete reduction of the fibres has not been effected
by the bleaching, this may be completed by the aid of
well-known machines, and either before or subsequent to
the after-bleaching there is used for 220 lbs. of straw
about 4½ lbs. of chloride of lime, at 35° [per cent.?] The
patentee then gives the following explanation:&mdash;"As pine
wood or fir is chemically freed from its colouring principle
and transformed into fibres as well as cellulose, the object
of the intense action of the chlorine is to destroy the mucilage
of the straw, as well as the incrusting matters
which have not been destroyed by the boiling with caustic
soda, and consequently to strip or expose and open the
fibres." It will be readily seen that this process bears a
close resemblance to Mr. C. Watt's wood-pulp process.</p>


<p><b>Electrolytic Bleaching</b> (<em>C. Watt, jun.'s, Process</em>).&mdash;At
the present time, when the means of obtaining the
electric current for practical purposes in the arts have
so far exceeded that which would have been deemed
probable some forty years since, we find that many
ingenious processes, which were found to be unpractical
at that time from the want of cheap electrical power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
have since reappeared in the form of patented inventions,
which would seem to possess every merit&mdash;but
originality.</p>

<p>So long ago as September 25th, 1851, the author's brother,
Mr. Charles Watt, obtained a patent for, amongst
other claims, decomposing chlorides of sodium and potassium,
and of the metals of the alkaline earths into hypochlorites
by electricity. It may be well to make a few
extracts here from his specification in order that some of
the subsequent patents, to which we shall refer, may be
traced to what may, perhaps, be considered their true
origin. In the specification in question, the inventor
says:&mdash;"The third part of my invention consists of a mode
of converting chlorides of potassium and sodium, and of
the metals of the alkaline earths, into hypochlorites and
chlorates, by means of a succession of decompositions in
the solution of the salt operated upon, when induced by
the agency of electricity.... Electricity first decomposes
the chloride, the chlorine being eliminated at one of
the electrodes, and the alkaline or earthy metallic base
at the other electrode.... The liberated chlorine will,
when it is set free, combine with a portion of alkali or
alkaline earth in the solution, and a hypochlorite will be
formed. The hypochlorite thus formed will, by the continued
action of heat, be resolved partly into a chlorate of
the alkali or alkaline earth, and partly into a chloride of
the metallic base, and the chloride will again be subjected
to decomposition, and a hypochlorite formed.... If I
desire to produce a hypochlorite of the alkali or earth, I
merely keep the vessel warm ... and continue the process
until as much of the saline matter has been converted
into a hypochlorite as may be required for the purpose to
which the solution is to be applied. This mode of forming
a hypochlorite of the alkalies and alkaline earths may
be used for preparing a bath for the purpose of bleaching
various kinds of goods, and the bath may be strengthened
[recuperated] from time to time by the action of the
electric current."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that this specification clearly described
a process by which the chlorides of sodium and
potassium, and of the metals of the alkaline earths (chloride
of magnesium, for example), may be converted into
hypochlorites by electrolysis, and the hypochlorite solution
obtained used for the purposes of bleaching. It would
appear difficult to conceive how any subsequent patent
for accomplishing the same thing, and using essentially
the same means, can claim originality in the face of such
"prior publication" as was effected by the usual "Blue-book,"
which any person can buy for eightpence.</p>


<p><b>Hermite's Process.</b>&mdash;The following description of this
process has been furnished by the engineers engaged in
connection with the process to the <cite>Paper Trade Review</cite>:&mdash;"Briefly
described, the Hermite process consists in manufacturing
a solution of high bleaching power by electrolysing
an aqueous solution of magnesium chloride. The
salt is decomposed by the current at the same time as the
water. The nascent chlorine, liberated from the magnesium
chloride, and the nascent oxygen, liberated from the
water, unite at the positive pole, and produce an unstable
oxygen compound of chlorine of very high bleaching
power. The hydrogen and magnesium go to the negative
pole; this last decomposes the water and forms magnesium
oxide, whilst the hydrogen is disengaged. If in this
liquid coloured vegetable fibre is introduced, the oxygen
compound acts on the colouring matter, oxidising it.
Chlorine combines with the hydrogen to form hydrochloric
acid, which finding itself in the presence of magnesium in
the liquid combines with it, and forms the initial chloride
of magnesium."</p>


<p><b>Andreoli's Process.</b>&mdash;This process consists, avowedly,
in bleaching pulps "by means of hypochlorite of sodium,
produced by electrolytical decomposition of a solution of
chloride of sodium." In carrying out his process, M. Andreoli
uses as an electrolyte "concentrated or non-concentrated
sea-water, or a solution of chloride of sodium, the
specific gravity of which varies according to the quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and nature of the materials to be treated. Generally the
solution to be electrolysed works better with a density of
8° to 12° B., but although salt is cheap, and the solution
when exhausted may be regenerated by passing an electric
current, I always endeavour to have when possible (<em>sic</em>) a
weak solution, and with some kinds of pulp an electrolyte
having the density of sea-water (3° B.) is sufficiently strong
to bleach."</p>

<p>The foregoing are the only electrolytic processes for
bleaching fibres that need recording, and we fancy there
will be little difficulty in tracing the resemblance between
the two latter and the process of Mr. C. Watt.</p>


<p><b>Thompson's Process.</b>&mdash;This process, for which a patent
was obtained on February 3rd, 1883, may be thus briefly
described:&mdash;In bleaching linen fabrics the material is boiled
for about three hours in a solution of cyanide of potassium
or sodium&mdash;about half an ounce of the salt to each gallon
of water&mdash;to remove the resinous matter from the fibre, so
that the cellulose may be exposed to the action of the
bleach. The fabric is then washed, and again boiled for
three hours more in a similar solution, and after being
again washed is ready for bleaching. With cotton the
preliminary boiling is not necessary, unless the material
is greasy, in which case a solution of half the strength
and two hours' boiling is sufficient. In ordinary cases
cotton is not boiled at all, but is simply washed in cold
water and squeezed. In bleaching, all vegetable fibres are
treated in the same way, the only difference being in
point of time. The cotton or linen, after being treated as
described, is then piled somewhat loosely in an air-tight
vessel, 9 lbs. of cloth to the cubic foot of space being considered
sufficient. The vessel is then filled with a weak
solution of bleaching liquor, consisting of about one ounce
of dry bleaching powder to each gallon of water. "After
the vessel has been filled, the liquor is immediately run
out, and is replaced by an atmosphere of carbonic acid,
which quickly liberates the chlorine on the fibre, and thus
decomposes the water, uniting with the hydrogen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
liberating the oxygen, the result of which, is to bleach the
fibre or fabric. In about an hour the whole of the bleaching
liquor in the fibre will have been thus decomposed,
and this operation must be repeated until the material is
of the proper whiteness to be withdrawn from the action
of the chlorine. The material is then washed and squeezed.
Chlorine, however, always leaves these materials of a
yellowish white." To remove this tint, the material is
passed through a solution of oxalic acid&mdash;about 2 oz. to
the gallon&mdash;squeezed as it passes out of this solution, and
then passed through another solution made by dissolving
¼ grain of triethyl rose aniline to the gallon of water, or
20 grains of indigo, as may be preferred. To this solution
oxalic acid is added until it becomes of an opaque but bright
turquoise blue. The material, after washing, is then white.</p>

<p>The patent describes and illustrates the apparatus to be
used in conjunction with certain parts of existing apparatus
used in bleaching.</p>


<p><b>Lunge's Process.</b>&mdash;In this process acetic acid is used
in place of hydrochloric or sulphuric acids, etc., to set free
the chlorine or hypochlorous acid, in the ordinary method
of bleaching with hypochlorite of lime, or bleaching
powder, which, the inventor says, "combines all the advantages
of the materials formerly employed, without any
of their drawbacks.... The price is no impediment,
for a minimal quantity is sufficient, the same being regenerated
over and over again. At first acetic acid and
chloride of lime decompose into calcium acetate and free
hypochlorous acid. In the bleaching process the latter
yields its oxygen, hydrochloric acid being formed. The
latter instantly acts upon the calcium acetate; calcium
chloride is formed and acetic acid is regenerated, which
decomposes a fresh quantity of chloride of lime, and so
forth. Consequently the smallest quantity of acetic acid
suffices for splitting up any amount of chloride of lime.... The
hydrochloric acid formed is never present in
the free state, as it instantly acts upon the calcium acetate.
This is very important, since hydrochloric acid weakens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the fibre by prolonged contact, whilst acetic acid is quite
harmless. Since there are no insoluble calcium salts present,
the operation of 'souring' after bleaching is quite
unnecessary; this not merely saves the expense of acid,
and of the subsequent washing of the fabrics, but it also
avoids the danger, especially present in the case of stout
fabrics, of leaving some of the acid in the stuff, which
concentrates on drying and weakens the fibre; it may
also prove injurious in subsequent dyeing operations.
But in the new process no free acid is present except
acetic acid, which has no action upon fibre, even in its
concentrated state and at a high temperature."</p>

<p>The acetic acid may be employed in various ways, including
the following:&mdash;A small quantity of the acid may
be added from the first to the bleaching liquor; or the
fabric, after being treated in the ordinary way with a
solution of the bleaching powder, may be steeped, without
previous washing, in water containing a little acetic acid;
or the fabric may be steeped in water acidulated with
acetic acid, and bleaching liquor afterwards run in slowly
and gradually, with continuous agitation in the usual way.
In the case of hard water, or of impure bleaching liquors,
a good deal of the acetic acid would be consumed in
neutralising the lime; in this case, some hydrochloric or
sulphuric acid may be added, but only sufficient for the
purpose, so that no acid but hypochlorous or acetic acid
exists in the free state. The process is applicable to the
bleaching of vegetable fibres, whether spun or in the unspun
state, and for bleaching paper pulp made from rags,
wood, straw, esparto, etc. Besides acetic acid, any other
weak organic acid of an analogous nature may be used.</p>


<p><b>Zinc Bleach Liquor.</b>&mdash;Strong acids are often objectionable
for liberating chlorine from bleaching powder, and
especially in bleaching some classes of paper pulp. If a
solution of sulphate of zinc be added to one of bleaching
powder, sulphate of lime is precipitated, and the zinc
hypochlorite formed at once splits up into zinc oxide and
a solution of free hypochlorous acid. Chloride of zinc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
acts similarly; for a saturated solution of zinc in hydrochloric
acid decomposes as much bleaching powder as half
its weight of concentrated oil of vitriol.&mdash;<cite>Varrentrapp.</cite>
Consequently zinc salts can be employed in place of
sulphuric acid, and thus bleach the paper pulp very
quickly. When this mixture is employed in bleaching
pulp, the precipitated sulphate of lime resulting from the
reaction and also the oxide of zinc formed, remain in the
pulp, and serve as loading materials.</p>


<p><b>Alum Bleach Liquor.</b>&mdash;Orioli<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> recommended for use,
in paper-mills especially, a bleach liquor made by decomposing
equivalent quantities of a solution of chloride of
lime and sulphate of alumina, formerly known as <em>Wilson's
Bleach Liquor</em>. Sulphate of lime is precipitated, and
hypochlorite of aluminium remains in solution; this
being a very unstable salt can be applied for bleaching
without the addition of an acid, splitting up into aluminium
chloride and active oxygen. Consequently the
liquid always remains neutral, and the difficulty caused
by the obstinate retention of free acid in the fibre, by
which it is strongly acted upon in drying, in this case
does not exist. The aluminium chloride also acts as an
antiseptic, so that the paper stock may be kept for many
months without undergoing fermentation or other decomposition.
The solution is allowed to act for about ten
minutes in the engine.&mdash;<cite>Lunge.</cite></p>


<p><b>New Method of Bleaching.</b>&mdash;Young's Paraffin Oil
Company have recently introduced what they term an
"intermediate oil for paper-making," to be used with
alkali in the boiling of rags and esparto, for the purpose
of increasing the bleaching power of the powder, and producing
a softer pulp, at the same time having no smell.
Several well-known paper-makers have tried, and speak
favourably of it. The quantity of oil to be added to the
caustic varies for different stock, but may be said to
average about 1½ gallon per ton.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Beating.</b>&mdash;One of the most important operations in
the manufacture of first-class paper is that of <em>beating</em>, by
which the half-stuff becomes reduced to a fine state of
division, and the fibres which, in the condition of half-stuff,
are more or less loosely held together in a clotted
state, become separated, and are thus put into a condition
in which they will intertwine with each other, or <em>felt</em>, as it
is termed, when submitted to the vibratory motion of the
wire-cloth of the paper machine. The beating-engine, or
beater, as it is commonly called, much resembles in construction
the washing- and breaking-engine, but since it is
required to still further reduce the pulp to a condition
suitable for paper-making, the knives of this engine are
more numerous and are made to revolve more rapidly.
In this engine the half-stuff is cleansed from bleach,
hydrochloric or sulphuric acid&mdash;whichever acid may
have been used in the bleaching&mdash;chloride of calcium, and
the various products resulting from the decomposition of
the chloride of lime. In this engine, also, the loading,
sizing, and colouring materials are worked up with the
pulp, and the stuff fully prepared for its final transfer
direct to the paper-machine. Before describing the various
forms of beating-engines which have been from time to
time introduced, including some of the most recent types,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to which special attention will be drawn, we purpose
quoting some observations of well-known experts in paper
manufacture which will be read with interest, since they
fully explain the importance that attaches to the proper
manipulation of the beating-engine for the production of
paper of high quality.</p>


<p><b>Mr. Dunbar's Observations on Beating.</b>&mdash;There is
no operation of the paper-mill that requires more careful
attention and experienced judgment than that of beating,
or refining, to bring the pulp to the finest possible condition
for paper-making; in this department, Mr. Dunbar
urges, "none but thoroughly efficient men should be
employed, for it is here that the paper is really made&mdash;that
is, the quality of the paper produced at the paper-machine
will be in proportion to the treatment the material
has received; and if the half-stuff sent to the
beating-engines is not subjected to judicious manipulation
and careful preparation for the special paper to be made,
all future doctoring will prove unsatisfactory."</p>


<p><b>Mr. Arnot on Beating Engines.</b>&mdash;On this subject Mr.
Arnot says:&mdash;"Upon the management of the beating-engine
the character of the paper produced largely depends. What
is wanted is not a mincing or grinding of the fibre, but a
drawing out or separation of the fibres one from another;
in fact, the name of the machine indicates pretty accurately
the nature of the action required&mdash;beating. Long,
fine fibres can only be produced [obtained] by keeping the
roll slightly up off the bed-plate, and giving it time to do
the work. Sharp action between the roll and the bed-plate
will, no doubt, make speedy work of the fibre, but
the result will be short particles of fibre only, which will
not interlace to make a strong felt. Indeed, the action I
refer to will reduce the long, strong fibre of linen to little
better than that of wood or straw. Practice and careful
observation can alone make a good beater-man, and for
the finer classes of paper none but careful, experienced
men should be entrusted with the management of the
beating-engine. Sometimes the operation is conducted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
two successive engines, the first being called the intermediate
beater, but I have hitherto failed to see wherein
the advantage of this system lies. The time usually occupied
in beating esparto for printing-paper is about four
hours, while for rags the time may vary from four to
twelve hours, or even more." This, however, depends
upon the nature of the rags themselves, and the purposes
to which they are to be applied.</p>


<p><b>Mr. Wyatt on American Refining-Engines.</b>&mdash;Referring
to the engines adopted in America, Mr. Wyatt says:&mdash;"There
are various modifications of the original Jordan,
the principal ones being the Marshall, Jeffers, and improved
Jordan; but I gathered that experience proves
the Jordan type to be the most practical and efficient
in the end, and is one of the most generally used. One
Jordan is required for each machine, refining all the
stuff supplied to it. The roll, or plug, runs from 350 to
400 revolutions per minute, the horse-power consumed
varying from 25 to 40 horse-power according to the work
done, and an engine will do up to 1,000 lbs. of pulp
per hour. The time saved in the beating-engine by the
use of the Jordan is just about one-third of what would
otherwise be necessary, that is to say, pulp requiring
otherwise six hours beating only takes four hours if
finished in the Jordan. The half-beaten pulp is emptied
into a stuff-chest, and the Jordan is furnished with a small
stuff-pump and service-box, just as at the paper-machine
what the Jordan does not take flows back again into the
chest: the pulp from the Jordan is run into the ordinary
machine stuff-chests. The finished pulp can be
taken from the Jordan at three different levels from the
circumference of the roll, or plug. If the pulp is wanted
'free,' it is drawn from the bottom of the engine; if
wanted 'wet,' or well greased, it is drawn from the top;
and if medium from the centre."</p>


<p><b>The Beating-Engine.</b>&mdash;The ordinary form of beater
consists of a cast-iron trough 13 feet 6 inches long × 6 feet
6 inches wide, and the bottom is dish-shaped, so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
prevent the pulp from lodging, which would inevitably
be the case if the bottom were flat, as the pulp would
be apt to lodge in the angles formed by the junction of
the bottom with the vertical walls of the trough. The
iron trough is fitted with a cast-iron roll, 3 feet 6
inches × 3 feet 6 inches, which is provided with 69 "roll-bars,"
or knives, arranged in 23 groups of 3 bars each;
this roll is suspended upon a malleable iron shaft
5 inches in diameter, resting upon side levers; suitable
gearing is attached by which the roll can be lifted or
lowered at will, the action being uniformly equal on both
sides, by which the knives of the roll are kept uniform
with those of the bed-plate beneath. The bed-plate, furnished
with 20 steel knives, of the same length as the
roll, is placed immediately beneath the roll. When the
knives of the bed-plate are straight they are fitted into
the plate-box at an angle, but in some cases they are bent
at a slight angle, when they are termed <em>elbow plates</em>.
There have been, however, many improvements in the
beating-engine introduced of late years, some of which
are of considerable importance, and to some of these we
will now direct attention. Although our own manufacturers
have introduced improvements in beaters which have been
fully recognised by the trade, the American engineers
have not been behindhand in devising modifications
which appear to have some important advantages. The
Jordan beater, which has been extensively adopted in
the States, consists of a roll in the form of a truncated
cone, furnished with knives in the usual way; this revolves
in a box of a similar form, fitted with knives in the direction
of its length, but at slightly different angles. In
this engine the stuff enters at the narrow end through
a box having an arrangement which regulates its flow,
and the pulp is discharged by several openings in the
cover at the wider end. In an engine invented by Mr.
Kingsland there is a circular chamber furnished with
knives covering its sides; between this is a circular plate,
also fitted with knives, which revolves. The stuff enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
through a pipe in the centre of one of the sides of the
chamber, and flows out through an opening in the opposite
side.</p>

<p><b>Forbes' Beating Engine.</b>&mdash;This engine, an illustration
of which is given in Fig. 21, is manufactured by Bertrams,
Limited, of St. Katherine's Works, Edinburgh.
The engine has three chambers, two rolls, and a mixing
wheel; the rolls, only one of which is uncovered in the
engraving, are fixed in the outer channels, and the mixing
wheel is placed in the middle channel. By this arrangement
the pulp flows alternately into the two outer channels,
and after passing through the rolls again it enters
the centre channel at the opposite end.</p>

<p><b>Umpherston's Beating Engine.</b>&mdash;This engine, for
which a patent was granted in 1880, has been successfully
adopted at the <em>Daily Chronicle</em> and other mills, and presents
several important advantages, one of the chief being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that it occupies much less ground space than ordinary
beating-engines. Indeed, we have heard it remarked of
this engine that it will do double the amount of work in
the same ground space as the ordinary engine, and this,
in some mills, would be a decided advantage. The construction
of this beater, a drawing of which is shown in
Fig. 22, is thus described by the patentee:&mdash;"In the
common and almost universal form of engines used for
preparing pulp for paper-making, the pulp travels horizontally
in a trough with semi-circular ends, and straight
sides, partly divided longitudinally by a partition called
the midfeather, around which the pulp flows from the
back of the roll to its front, where it passes under the roll
and over the bottom working-plate, and is again delivered
over the back fall to pass again round the midfeather to
the front of the roll. In the course of these repeated
revolutions part of the pulp near the circumference of the
tub has much farther to travel than the part near the midfeather,
and consequently is not so often operated upon,
and the pulp is thus unequally treated. As an improvement
upon this form of tub, I make it so that the pulp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
passes from the back of the roll to its front through a
longitudinal passage under the back fall, the pulp thus
moving as through an inverted syphon, the superincumbent
weight of the semi-fluid pulp, as delivered over the
back fall of the roll, pressing it along this passage and
upwards, to enter again in front of the roll. The roll <span class="fs70">A</span>,
bottom plate <span class="fs70">B</span>, and the form of the back fall <span class="fs70">C</span>, are similar
to those of ordinary engines, but the trough is formed
with the passage <span class="fs70">D</span> under the bottom plate <span class="fs70">B</span>, so that the
semi-fluid contents of the engine, in travelling from the
back fall <span class="fs70">C</span> to the front of the roll <span class="fs70">A</span>, pass by means of the
passage <span class="fs70">D</span> under the bottom plate <span class="fs70">B</span> in the direction indicated
by the arrows, the superincumbent weight of the semi-fluid
pulp, as it is delivered over the back fall <span class="fs70">C</span> at the back
of the roll <span class="fs70">A</span>, pressing it along the under passage <span class="fs70">D</span> and upwards
to the front of the roll <span class="fs70">A</span>. The position of a drum-washer
is shown at <span class="fs70">E</span>, and at <span class="fs70">F</span> is seen a section of the
cross shaft for raising or lowering both ends of the roll <span class="fs70">A</span>
simultaneously; <span class="fs70">G</span> is the roll cover, which may be of any
usual form. By this invention the semi-fluid pulp is
acted upon in a more effective manner, and its particles are
also more equally treated than has hitherto been the case."</p>

<p>The beating-engines are usually driven from a separate
engine, but Messrs. Bertrams have introduced a system of
direct driving for these engines by which, it is said, there
is a considerable saving in power. The accompanying
engravings, Figs. 23 and 24, show a series of eight beaters,
each carrying 300 lbs. of pulp, driven by one of their compound
direct-driving steam-engines, and now being worked
at the Forth Paper Mills.</p>


<p><b>Operation of Beating.</b>&mdash;Having referred to some of
the more important improvements connected with the
beating-engines, we will proceed to explain the operation
of beating as briefly as possible. The bleached
half-stuff is removed from the tray of the press in
caked masses, and in this condition is conveyed in trucks
or boxes to the beating-engine. The first thing to
be attended to is the removal of the last traces of chlorine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
from the pulp, which, if not effectually done, would cause
injury to the size, and also corrode the strainer plates
and wire-gauze of the paper-machine. It is possible
to wash out the chlorine by an abundant application of
pure water, but this method of removing the chlorine is
very tedious and occupies a long time, while it also involves
the use of enormous quantities of water&mdash;a serious consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in some mills; to this may be added the still more
important fact that by the method of washing out the
chlorine a considerable loss of fibre takes place. The plan
most usually adopted is to neutralise the chlorine left in the
pulp by the application of suitable chemical agents, whereby
the chlorine is rendered inert. These agents, technically
termed "antichlors," are sometimes objected to, however,
although they are in themselves practically harmless so far
as their action upon cellulose is concerned. Mr. Arnot,
who has considered this subject very thoroughly, says:&mdash;"I
do not think there is much in this objection, as those
agents that are soluble pass through the wire of the
machine almost completely, while those that are insoluble
are in the finest possible state of division and pearly white.
The chemical agent most largely used is hyposulphite of
soda, but hyposulphite of lime is also employed, and
those agents, known by the name of 'antichlor,' are put
into the engine in such a quantity as will ensure the
neutralisation of the whole of the chlorine. The products
of the reaction, when the soda salts are used, are
chloride of sodium (common salt) and sulphate of soda
(Glauber's salt), and, when the lime salt is used, chloride of
calcium and sulphate of lime, the latter identical with the
pearl hardening so well known as a loading agent." From
this it will be seen that little or no harm can possibly
occur either to the fibre or the metal work of the machine
by the employment of the neutralising agents named, and
when it is borne in mind that the simple washing of the
pulp would occupy the beating-engine for a lengthened
period and exhaust a considerable quantity of water&mdash;which,
as we have said, would in some mills be a serious matter&mdash;the
adoption of the neutralising method would undoubtedly
have the preference.</p>

<p>The engine, being partly filled with water, is set in
motion, and the bleached half-stuff introduced in small
quantities at a time, each portion being allowed to become
thoroughly mixed with the water before the next batch is
added. The charging of the beater with half-stuff is kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
up until the mass becomes so thick that it will only just
move in the trough under the action of the revolving roll.
If the beater is of the older type, portions of the pulp are
liable to lodge in corners, to remove which the "beater-man"
uses a wooden paddle, with which tool he also pushes
the slowly moving pulp in the direction of the roll, especially
when the stiff mass appears to move too slowly.
At this stage the neutralisation of the chlorine in the
pulp is effected, which is done by adding a solution of
hyposulphite of soda, a little at a time, until the liquor
ceases to redden blue litmus paper, strips of which
should be dipped into the pulp every few minutes until
the paper persistently retains its blue colour. This
operation should be conducted with great care, so as to
exactly neutralise the traces of chlorine without adding an
excess of the hyposulphite of soda. Besides this salt,
other substances are used as "antichlors," as, for example,
hyposulphite of lime, which is prepared by boiling milk of
lime (slacked lime made into a thin mixture with water)
and flour of sulphur in an iron vessel until the latter is
dissolved, when, after cooling and settling, the resulting
solution, which is of an orange-yellow colour, is ready for
use. One great objection to the use of hyposulphite of
lime, however, is that when decomposed by the chloride of
lime remaining in the pulp sulphur is set free, which,
mingling with pulp, will impart to it a yellow tint; besides
this, in passing over the drying cylinders of the
machine the sulphur present in the paper may attract
oxygen from the air, converting it into sulphuric acid,
which must inevitably prove injurious to the manufactured
paper. Sulphite of soda has also been used as an antichlor,
and is said to be preferable to hyposulphite of soda,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> inasmuch
as the latter salt is liable to decompose with the
liberation of free acid, which is not the case with the
sulphite of soda.</p>


<p><b>Test for Chlorine.</b>&mdash;Instead of relying solely upon the
litmus paper test when applying the antichlor, the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
test for chlorine may also be used with advantage:&mdash;Take
2 drachms (120 grains) of white starch, and make it
into a paste with a little cold water; then pour over it
about half a pint of boiling water, stirring briskly; to this
add 1 drachm of iodide of potassium, and stir until dissolved
and well incorporated with the starch solution.
The mixture is then to be allowed to cool, when it is
ready for use. A few drops of this mixture dropped
upon a small sample of the pulp will indicate if any
chlorine be present by the spot assuming a blue colour;
if such be not the case, the pulp may be considered free
from chlorine.</p>

<p>During the beating, the roll, which should make not less
than 220 revolutions per minute, is lowered, a little at a
time, so that the cutting edges of the bars and plate may
be brought together gradually and equally until the pulp
is reduced to the desired condition. The pulp is made
long or short according to the quality of paper to be produced;
news papers, which require strength, are made of
long-fibred pulp, while writing paper, or paper of fine
texture, is made of shorter pulp. The stuff should be
what is called "mellowed" in the engine, which is effected
by a judicious working of the roll, not lowering it suddenly
but gradually, and not much at one time, on the
plate, until the pulp attains the fineness required. This is
generally arrived at in about three and a half to four
hours, though sometimes the beating of pulp from rags
is continued for more than double that time. It should
be added that if the cutting edges of the roll and plate
are brought together suddenly and too closely, the fibre
will be cut, and as a consequence the paper produced will
be tender.</p>

<p>Esparto, which, in the process of boiling becomes reduced
to such a soft condition that the fibres may be readily
separated by the fingers, does not require such excessive
beating as rags; indeed, the perfect disintegration of the
fibres of esparto is practically accomplished in about half
the time occupied by rags, and often much less, but this of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
course depends upon the nature of the esparto itself and
upon the thoroughness of the boiling. Wood pulps also
require but moderate beating, since the process of disintegration
is generally pretty effectually accomplished by
the processes to which the raw material is subjected in the
course of manufacture into half-stuff, which is the condition
in which this paper material is furnished to the
manufacturer.</p>


<p><b>Blending.</b>&mdash;To produce papers of the different qualities
required by the trade, a system of blending is adopted,
which may be effected&mdash;(1) by mixing the materials in the
raw state, or the rags, previous to boiling; and (2) blending
the half-stuff in the beating-engine. The latter method,
however, is generally preferred. Sometimes, also, pulps of
different character are beaten separately and then mixed
in the stuff-chests, where they are mixed as thoroughly as
possible before passing on to the machine, but this method
would be less likely to ensure a perfect mixture of the
respective pulps than would be effected with proper care in
the beater. The proportions of the several materials to be
blended is also a matter of important consideration. In
blending esparto with rag stuff, if the former be in excess
it becomes reduced to the proper condition before the latter
is sufficiently fine, which causes the rag fibre to appear in
"knots and threads" in the manufactured paper. But if
the rag stuff be allowed to predominate, the beating is
conducted as though no esparto were present, by which,
while the rag stuff becomes reduced to the proper length
of fibre, the esparto, which is still further reduced, in
mingling with the longer fibre of the rags forms what is
called a "close" paper. Mr. Dunbar, in his useful little
work, "The Practical Paper-maker," furnishes a series of
receipts for blending for high-class papers, as also the proportions
of colouring matter to be used, which the reader
will do well to consult. For news papers, esparto and straw
pulps are generally used, in varying proportions according
to the nature and quality of the esparto; these proportions
have to be regulated according to the judgment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
paper-maker, and vary greatly at different mills. A large
quantity of sulphite and other wood pulps are also used,
those coming from Scandinavia and Germany being especially
suited to the requirements of the English manufacturer.
Mechanical wood pulp is also used in a moderate
degree&mdash;sometimes up to 15 per cent., in some English
mills, but it is said that in Germany this paper stock is
sometimes used to the extent of 90 per cent.</p>

    </div>


<p class="noindent"><b>Loading.</b>&mdash;The very finest qualities of paper are usually
made without the addition of any <em>loading</em>, as it is called,
but for most other papers more or less loading material is
added, according to the quality of paper to be produced.
The loading material used for ordinary qualities is kaolin,
or china clay, and for the better qualities sulphate of lime
or <em>pearl hardening</em>, as it is termed in the trade. China clay,
as it occurs in commerce, is in the form of soft lumps and
powder, is nearly white, and when rubbed between the
finger and thumb should present no hard particles of gritty
matter. To prepare it for mixing with the pulp it is first
worked up into a thin cream with water, which is usually
done in a vessel furnished with an agitating arrangement
by which the clay becomes intimately mixed with the
water. The cream is then strained through a fine sieve
to separate any impurities present, and is then allowed to
flow into the beating-engine containing the stuff while in
motion, by which it soon becomes mingled with the pulp.
The proportion of china clay or other loading material
which is to be introduced into the pulp depends upon the
quality of the fibre and the requirements of the manufacturer,
some makers using less of the material than others.
From 3 per cent. to 10 or 15 per cent. appears to be about
the extreme range for employing the material as a necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
ingredient, in the production of various classes of
paper, above which figures the addition of loading material
may be considered as an adulteration. Sometimes nearly
twice the largest amount named is employed, no doubt to
meet the exigences of keen competition&mdash;from foreign
sources especially.</p>

<p>One effect of the loading, whether it be china clay or
sulphate of lime, is to close the pores of the paper,
whereby a smoother surface is obtained, while at the same
time, if the material has been used in proportions suited
to the quality of the fibre, and not in immoderate excess,
a stronger paper is produced. A species of asbestos termed
<em>agalite</em> has been introduced as a loading material, and since
it has a fibrous texture, it blends with the fibres of the
pulp, forming, as it were, a vegeto-mineral paper. It is
stated that as much as 90 per cent. of the agalite used in
the beating-engine enters into the manufactured paper,
while not much more than half the china clay used is held
by the pulp.</p>


<p><b>Sizing.</b>&mdash;"Engine sizing," as it is termed, consists in
adding certain ingredients to the pulp while in the beating-engine.
The materials generally used are alum and resin
soap, in proportions suitable to the paper to be produced.
Resin soap is formed by boiling ordinary resin in a
jacketed pan such as is used by soapmakers for preparing
small quantities of fancy or other soaps, with a solution of
soda crystals in the following proportions: Resin, 16 lbs.;
soda crystals dissolved in water, 8 lbs.; and the boiling is
kept up for about two hours, or until a soap is produced
which is perfectly soluble in water. The method of preparing
this soap as conducted at the soapworks has been
described in the author's work on soap-making,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> p. 64, from
which the following abstract is taken: "Put into a pan
capable of holding about 12 gallons, 2¼ gallons of fresh
caustic soda ley at 30° B. Apply gentle heat, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the ley begins to boil throw in, every few minutes, in
small quantities at a time, finely powdered and sifted resin
until 37 lbs. have been introduced. The mixture must be
well stirred the whole time to prevent the resin from
'clogging' and adhering to the pan. It is important to
moderate the heat, as the resin soap has a great tendency
to expand and an excess of heat would cause it to boil
over. The heat, however, must be kept to near the boiling
point, otherwise the mass will become thick and of a
very dark colour. When kept at near the boiling point it
is always clear and its colour of a reddish yellow. If,
during the boiling, the resin soap rises and threatens to
overflow, the heat must be checked by throwing in a little
cold water, only using sufficient to effect this object. It
is absolutely necessary to stir the mass continually, otherwise
the resin will agglomerate in masses and thus prevent
the alkali from acting freely upon it. The boiling takes
about two hours, when the soap is run into an iron frame
and allowed to cool. It is very important that the resin
used is freed from particles of wood, straw, etc., for which
purpose it should be passed through a tolerably fine
sieve."</p>

<p>Respecting the preparation of resin soap, Davis says:&mdash;"The
proportion of resin used to each pound of soda ash
varies in different mills, 3, 4, or even 5 lbs. of resin being
used to each pound of soda ash. The proportion of resin,
soda ash, and water, can be best determined by practical
experience, as no prescription could be devised which
would be suitable to every case." M. d'Arcet, who modified
the proportions recommended by M. Bracconot,
recommends for the preparation of resin soap&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">Theoretically speaking, only 2·45 parts of alum would be
required to precipitate the resin; but the waters, which
are almost always calcareous, neutralise part of the alum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Crystals of soda are much more expensive than soda ash,
but on account of their greater purity they are sometimes
preferred to the latter. At the present day the resin soap
is preferably made by dissolving ordinary resin with a
solution of carbonate of soda under boiling heat in a steam-jacketed
boiler, the class of paper to be made governing
the quantity of resin to be employed. The boiling usually
requires from two to eight hours, according to the relative
proportions of soda ash and resin used&mdash;the greater
the proportion of soda used the less time is required for
boiling&mdash;the process being completed when a sample of the
soap formed is completely soluble in water.... About
3 lbs. of resin to 1 lb. of soda is the usual proportion. The
resin soap is cooled after boiling by running it into iron
tanks, where it is allowed to settle, the soap forming a
dense syrup-like mass, and the colouring matters and
other admixtures of the resin rising to the top are easily
removed. It is important to run off the mother liquor
(ley) containing the excess of alkali, for when the soap is
used it consumes the alum to neutralise it."</p>

<p>When the impurities and ley have been removed the
soap is dissolved in water, and if, from imperfect boiling,
a portion of the resin is found not to have been saponified,
a small quantity of a strong solution of soda crystals is
added to the water used for dissolving the soap.</p>

<p>Where starch is used for stiffening purposes, the soap is
mixed with a quantity of starch paste in the proportion of
1½ part of starch to 1 part of resin soap. Some manufacturers,
Mr. Davis states, mix the starch paste with the
kaolin in lieu of mixing it with the resin soap. In either
case the materials should be thoroughly strained before
being added to the pulp. From 3 to 4 lbs. of the mixture
of resin soap and starch paste to each 100 lbs. of dry pulp
are about the proportions in which the size is generally
used, but the quantity added to the pulp in the beater depends
upon whether the paper is to be soft-sized or hard-sized.</p>

<p>Sizing is chiefly applied to papers which are to be written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
upon with ordinary inks, and also, with a few exceptions,
to printing papers, the object being to close the
pores of the paper and render it non-absorbent, by which
the spreading or running of the ink is effectually prevented.
While the finest lines may be written upon a
well-sized paper (as ordinary writing paper, for example)
without spreading in the least degree, a similar stroke of
the pen upon blotting paper, tissue, or unsized printing
paper would spread in all directions, owing to the highly
absorptive property of the cellulose.</p>

<p>The sizing of the pulp is conducted as follows:&mdash;After
the loading material has been introduced and well mixed,
the resin soap, previously dissolved in water, a little
carbonate of soda being sometimes added, is mixed with a
paste of starch prepared by dissolving starch in boiling
water, and the mixture of soap and starch is then passed
through a fine sieve to keep back any particles or lumps
that may be present. The proportion of the materials
used in sizing vary at the different mills, each manufacturer
having formulæ of his own; about 1 part of resin size to
3 of starch paste, and, say, from 9 to 12 lbs. of the mixture,
may be used for 300 lbs. of pulp; and, if preferred,
the respective ingredients may be put into the engine
separately, a method adopted at some mills. Some manufacturers
of the finest papers, instead of dissolving the
starch in hot water, make it into a thin paste with cold
water, in which condition it is introduced into the pulp,
the object being to impart to the paper a particular
feeling to the touch which is not obtainable by other
means.</p>

<p>The mixture of resin size and starch paste, with or
without the addition of water, is added to the pulp in the
beater, in which the pulp is circulating, and the engine
allowed to run until the materials are well incorporated in
the pulp. At this stage a solution of alum (about 28 to
30 lbs. for 300 lbs. of pulp), or of sulphate of alumina,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is
introduced, which causes the resin soap to become "separated,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the sulphuric acid of the alum uniting with the
alkali of the soap and setting the resin and alumina free
in the form of minute particles; the resin in the subsequent
drying on the calenders becomes fused, as it were,
and thus cements the fibres and alumina together, at the
same time rendering them non-absorbent and improved in
whiteness by the precipitated alumina. Sometimes ordinary
soap is added to the resin soap, which is said to
impart a higher finish to the paper in the operation of
calendering.</p>

<p>The so-called "concentrated alum," which contains
a higher percentage of sulphate of alumina than the
crystallised alum, is considered the most economical in use,
being proportionately cheaper, and the variety known as
"pearl alum" is specially recommended. "Aluminous
cake" is another preparation which has found favour in
many mills, but since it sometimes contains a large excess
of free sulphuric acid it requires to be used with caution,
since this acid, although it will brighten the colour of
some aniline dyes, will discharge the colour from others,
while at the same time it may injuriously affect the brass-wire
cloths of the paper machine. The alum solution
should be prepared in a lead-lined tank, fitted with a steam
pipe for heating the contents when required.</p>

<p>The proportions of the materials used in sizing differ
considerably in different mills, but the following may be
taken as an average for common writing and printing
papers:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">To the sizing solution is generally added from 30 to 50
parts of kaolin. When a colour is present on which alum
would have a prejudicial effect this is usually replaced by
about one-third of its weight of sulphate of zinc. Many
mineral substances have from time to time been added to
paper stock, principally to increase its weight, and in
1858 Sholl took out a patent for adding carbonate of lime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a substance which, however, had long been fraudulently
used in order to increase the weight, but he found it to
have the property of fixing the ink in the pores of the
paper, thus rendering it immovable. The only useful
addition is kaolin, or some similar aluminous compound, as
it attaches itself to the fibre, and, while giving the required
opacity and a good surface, takes both printing and writing
ink well, and has the advantage, from a manufacturer's
point of view, of increasing the weight. It has been
proposed that small quantities of glycerine be added to
the pulp, in order to give the paper greater flexibility, and
especially to give copying-paper the quality of taking up
colour readily.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>


<p><b>French Method of Preparing Engine Size.</b>&mdash;Thirteen
pails of water are boiled in a copper-jacketed pan capable
of holding about 150 gallons; 90 lbs. of soda crystals are
then introduced and allowed to dissolve, when 200 lbs. of
finely-powdered resin are gradually introduced, with constant
stirring, and the boiling is sustained for about two
hours after the last portion of resin has been added. A
further addition of water is now made by putting in five
pails of cold water, and the water is then boiled for an
hour and a half longer. The resin soap is then transferred
to stock-chests, in which it is allowed to remain for ten
days or longer, fresh batches being prepared in rotation,
to meet the requirements of the mill.</p>

<p>To determine whether an excess of resin soap or of
alum has been added to the pulp, red and blue litmus
papers should be employed, the former turning blue if an
excess of resin soap be present, and the latter red when
alum or sulphate of alumina is in excess. For uncoloured
papers the aluminous material should be added until the
pulp becomes faintly acid, which will be indicated by the
blue litmus paper turning slightly red when immersed in
the pulp.</p>

<p>Besides resin soap, various substances have been proposed
as sizing materials, including wax dissolved in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
strong solution of caustic soda and precipitated with alum,
but the cost would be an objection to the use of this material
except for the highest classes of paper. It is stated
that 12 lbs. of gum tragacanth to each 500 lbs. of resin has
been used in preparing some kinds of engine-sized papers,
and is said to impart to them an appearance equal to that
of tub-sized papers.</p>


<p><b>Zinc Soaps in Sizing.</b>&mdash;According to a paragraph in the
<cite>Papermakers' Monthly Journal</cite>, a somewhat novel method
of sizing is employed in Germany, which consists in the precipitation
in the stock of zinc soaps. Cottonseed oil soap
or Castille soap is worked up in the engine with the stuff,
and after it has become well mixed with the pulp a solution
of sulphate of zinc is added, which results in the
formation of a white and heavy zinc soap, which is insoluble,
and adheres well to the fibres. The weight and
whiteness of the zinc soap are the main points in favour
of this method, which is said to yield good results.</p>


<p><b>Colouring.</b>&mdash;The pulp, after passing through the various
processes described, although apparently white, invariably
presents a yellow tinge when converted into paper. To
obviate this it is usual to "kill" the yellow tint by adding
to the pulp small quantities of blue and pink colouring
matters. The blue colours generally used are ultramarine,
smalts, and various aniline blues, and the pinks are usually
prepared from cochineal, either in a liquid form or as
"lakes" (compounds of cochineal and alumina) or aniline
dyes, the former being preferable, as it is not injuriously
affected by the alum used in sizing. The ultramarine
should be of good quality, otherwise it will become decomposed,
and its colouring property destroyed by the action
of the alum, but more especially so if the alum contains
an excess of free acid. Smalts blue, which is a kind of
coloured glass, is not affected by acids. In preparing the
colouring matters for mixing with the pulp they must
first be mixed with water, and the liquid should then be
strained, to keep back any solid particles that may be present
in the material. Aniline blues should be dissolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in hot water, or alcohol, and then diluted. Samples of the
pulp are examined from time to time until the desired
effect is produced, which the practised eye of the beater-man
can readily determine.</p>


<p><b>Animal or Tub-sizing.</b>&mdash;Another process of sizing,
termed "animal-sizing," "tub-sizing," or "surface-sizing,"
is also adopted in the manufacture of certain classes of
paper, and is either accomplished by hand or on the machine.
The former method having been elsewhere described
(p. 132) we will now describe the operation of sizing on the
machine, to which the term tub-sizing is also applied. The
size employed, which is prepared from what are called
"glue pieces," or clippings of "limed" and unhaired
skins of animals, requires to be as colourless as possible, in
order that the colour of the paper may not be injuriously
affected by it.</p>


<p><b>Preparation of Animal Size.</b>&mdash;This operation is generally
conducted at the mill, the materials from which the
size is produced being the cuttings or parings of animal
skins and hides, or <em>pelts</em>, which have undergone the processes
of "liming" and unhairing preparatory to being
tanned. The cuttings, or <em>pates</em>, commonly called "glue
pieces," are first soaked in a mixture of lime and water,
placed in large tubs for several days, after which they are
put into a wooden cylinder, or drum, five or six feet in
diameter, and about ten feet in length, which revolves upon
a horizontal shaft, which, being hollow, admits the passage
of water to the interior of the drum. The drum is perforated,
and revolves in a large tank, while a continuous
stream of water is allowed to pass through it, and the
dirty water escapes through the perforations in the drum.
When the cuttings are sufficiently cleansed in this way,
they are transferred to an iron copper, furnished with a
false bottom and steam-pipe, or a jacketed pan. The
cuttings are next covered with water; steam is then turned
on, and the liquid brought to a temperature below boiling
point, or say, about 180° to 190° F., it being very important
that the liquid should not actually boil. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
operation is carefully kept up for twelve to sixteen hours,
according to the nature of the cuttings, by which time all
the material excepting any membranous or fatty matters
that may be present, will have become dissolved and a
solution of gelatine obtained. The liquor is then allowed
to settle for a short time to allow fatty matters to rise to
the surface and membranous substances to deposit, and the
fatty matters must afterwards be carefully removed by
skimming. The liquor should next be strained to separate
any floating particles of a membranous character. Sometimes
the gelatine solution is clarified by adding a small
quantity of powdered lime, which is thoroughly mixed by
stirring, after which it is allowed to rest. When it is
found that the impurities and lime deposit too slowly, a
little weak sulphuric acid is added, which, forming an
insoluble sulphate of lime, the solid matters quickly subside,
leaving the liquor quite clear. The solution is next
filtered through felt, and is afterwards treated with a
solution of alum, which at first causes the liquid to thicken
and become nearly solid, but it becomes fluid again, however,
on the addition of more alum solution. When this
condition is finally attained, the liquid is ready for use in
the process of sizing. The addition of the alum (which
should not contain any free acid) to the gelatine greatly
improves its sizing property, besides preserving it from
decomposition. The treatment of the glue pieces for
the purpose of obtaining gelatine solutions is fully described
in the author's work on "Leather Manufacture,"
p. 401.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>


<p><b>American Method of Sizing.</b>&mdash;Another method of preparing
size, and which is adopted in America, is the following:&mdash;In
large paper mills the size is generally prepared in
a room devoted to the purpose, and is commonly situated near
the machine. The finest grades of light hide and skin clippings
are used for No. 1 letter papers, but less costly stock
is employed for the lower grades of animal-sized papers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
To preserve the glue pieces the tanners and tawers macerate
the clippings in milk of lime and afterwards dry them.
As the clippings require to be freed from the lime, the
first treatment they receive at the paper-mill is to put
them in large wooden tubs partly filled with water, in
which they are allowed to soak for several days. They
are afterwards more perfectly cleansed by means of a drum-washer,
such as we have before described. Fresh hide and
skin clippings, that is, those which have not been limed and
dried at the tanneries, and which are occasionally purchased
by the paper manufacturers, require to be used as soon as
possible after they arrive at the mill as they readily decompose,
and are placed in tubs partly filled with water, in
which 2 per cent. by weight of caustic lime has been dissolved.
The pieces, if from calfskins, are allowed to
remain in the lime bath for ten to fifteen days, clippings
of sheepskins fifteen to twenty days, and trimmings from
heavy hides, as ox, etc., twenty-five to thirty days, the
milk of lime being renewed once or twice a week, and the
material well stirred from time to time. The glue-stock,
as it is sometimes termed, is afterwards thoroughly washed
in the drum-washer, and when this operation is complete
the material is spread out in the yard to drain, and when
sufficiently dried is ready for boiling, or may be stored
until required for use.</p>

<p>To prepare size from the material treated as described,
it is placed in a boiler of cast or wrought-iron or copper,
furnished with a perforated false bottom, and capable of
holding from 100 to 400 lbs. of the raw material, according
to the requirements of the mill. Several such boilers
may be placed close to each other. At the bottom of the
boiler is a stop-cock for drawing off the gelatine solution
when required. When the requisite charge of glue-stock
has been introduced into the boiler, water is poured over
it and steam turned on, which passes through a pipe fixed
beneath the false bottom, and care is taken that the temperature
of the contents of the boiler should not exceed
200° F., which heat is kept up for ten to eighteen hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
according to the nature of the materials treated. The
gelatine solution is drawn off from the boiler as it is
formed, into wooden tubs, and at the same time carefully
strained to remove membranous matters and suchlike
impurities. Several boilings are made from the same
batch of glue-stock, and all the solutions are afterwards
mixed together in the receiving tubs, and a solution of
alum is added in such proportions as to be recognised by
tasting the liquor. One object in adding the alum being
to prevent the gelatine from decomposing, more of this
substance should be added in warm than in cold weather.</p>

<p>When the solutions are cool they are ready for use, and
the gelatine is removed from the receiving tubs and dissolved
in a separate tub as required for use, the dissolving
tub being provided with a steam-pipe. The proportion
of water&mdash;which should only be lukewarm&mdash;used in
dissolving the gelatine varies from a quarter to half
the bulk of the latter, the nature of the fibre and thickness
of the paper regulating the proportion of water to
gelatine, the strength of the size liquors being greater for
thin papers and weak fibres than for thick papers and
strong fibres.</p>

<p>The operation of sizing is considered one of the most
difficult and uncertain with which the paper-maker has to
deal, since the material (gelatine) is greatly influenced by
the conditions of the atmosphere, both as regards its temperature
and humidity, while the temperature of the
liquid size itself has also an important influence on the
success of the operation. The condition of the paper,
again, also affects the result, for if it be highly porous it
will probably be weak, and consequently there may be
considerable waste during the process of sizing from the
necessary handling it is subjected to; moreover, should the
paper have been blued with ultramarine, a strongly offensive
odour is often imparted to it; this, however, may be
obviated by employing fresh size and drying the paper as
completely as possible. There are two systems of animal-sizing
employed at the mill, namely, hand-sizing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
machine-sizing, which is also called tub-sizing, the former
being applied to papers of the finest quality. Papers that
have been made by the machine, after being cut into
sheets, are hand-sized, as described in the next chapter.</p>


<p><b>Machine-Sizing.</b>&mdash;The lower-priced papers, to be machine-sized,
are first partly dried over a few cylinders,
after which the paper passes through a tank containing
liquid size, from whence it passes between two rollers,
which squeeze out the superfluous size; it is then wound
on to a reel on which it remains some time to enable the
size to thoroughly permeate the paper, after which it is
wound on to another reel, and from thence it passes over a
series of wooden drums or cylinders, each of which is
furnished with a revolving fan; by this means the paper
becomes dried slowly, whereby a more perfect sizing of the
material is effected.</p>


<p><b>Double-Sized Paper.</b>&mdash;This term is applied to paper
which, after being sized in the engine in the usual way, is
afterwards "surface sized," as it is called, with animal size
in the manner described.</p>

<p>Respecting the drying of paper after it has been tub-sized
there seems to be some difference of opinion as to
whether it is best to hang it in a loft to dry or to dry it
over the cylinders of a drying machine. Upon this point
the New York <cite>Paper Trade Journal</cite> makes the following
remarks:&mdash;"When the paper is passed through the size-tub,
it is again wet; the fibres expand, and their hold on
each other is relaxed. Now it must make a difference to
the subsequent strength and quality of this paper whether
it be hung up in a loft to dry or run over a drying machine.
If it is hung in the loft no strain is put upon it
and the fibres are at liberty to shrink, or slowly contract,
in all directions; whereas if it is run over a drying
machine, consisting of from 50 to 100 reels, the longitudinal
strain prevents the fibres from shrinking and reassuming
their normal position in that direction. Attempts have
been made to obviate this defect by regulating the speed
of each section of the machine in such a manner as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
allow for the shrinking, but this only remedies the evil by
preventing the paper from breaking as it travels over the
machine. Everything else being equal, it would seem that
loft-dried paper must be superior to that dried over the
drying machine. Our home manufacturers endorse this
view, inasmuch as they continue to prefer the system of
loft-drying to the less expensive machine methods."</p>


<p><b>Mr. Wyatt's Remarks on Sizing.</b>&mdash;Mr. James W.
Wyatt, in a paper on the "Art of Paper-making,"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
makes the following observations on engine-sizing and animal-sizing
which will be read with interest:&mdash;"Engine-sizing
renders the paper fully as non-absorbent as animal
size. The latter penetrates the sheets only slightly and
forms a coating or skin on each surface, whereas the
engine size surrounds each fibre and impregnates the
whole mass. Surface-sizing, however, produces a stronger,
firmer sheet, and is smoother for the pen to travel over;
the manufacturer also gets the benefit in the price of the
paper of the additional weight of the size, amounting to
7 per cent. on the average. On the other hand, as the
animal size is mostly a skin on the surface, if the coating
be broken anywhere by the use of a knife in scratching,
the paper will only imperfectly resist ink in that place, a
great disadvantage for account and office-books and ledgers.
Engine-sized paper is much cheaper to produce than animal
sized, and is therefore used principally for the lower
qualities of writings and for almost all kinds of printings
where firmness and smoothness is not so much a desideratum.
Most tub-sized papers have a certain portion of
engine size mixed with the pulp. This not only ensures
the thorough sizing of the sheet, but also is a measure of
economy in reducing the absorbing power of the paper for
the animal size. Papers for ledgers and office-work are best
given an extra proportion of engine size to ensure their
ink-resisting properties, and they are also sized by hand
in animal size and loft dried." The following rough
estimate of the comparative cost in materials and wages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of engine-sizing and animal-sizing paper may be of
interest:</p>

<div class="blockquot pad2">

<p>The Vat and Mould.&mdash;Making the Paper.&mdash;Sizing and Finishing.</p></div>
    </div>


<p class="noindent">Under the old system of making paper by hand, the rags
were reduced to a fine state of division by a process of
<em>retting</em>, or slow putrefaction. The rags were first washed
in water, and then piled in heaps, in which condition they
were allowed to remain until they became tender, that is,
readily pulled asunder by the fingers. During the decomposition
the rags not unfrequently became rotten in some
portions of the heaps, thus involving considerable loss of
fibre. The rags were next placed in a strong chest, in
which iron-shod stamping rods were fitted, and these
by their continued action gradually reduced them to a
pulp. The stampers were eventually superseded by the
beating-engine, the invention of a Dutchman, which
received and still retains the name of the "Hollander."
Other machines, as the duster, washing and breaking
engines, and the beating engine, have entirely taken the
place of the older system, which required the work of forty
pairs of stamps for twenty-four hours to produce one
hundredweight of paper.</p>


<p><b>The Vat and Mould.</b>&mdash;The pulp being prepared, is
conveyed from the beaters to the working vat, where it is
diluted with water. The vat is a wooden or stone vessel
about 5 feet square and 4 feet deep, being somewhat wider
at the top than at the bottom. A steam-pipe is supplied
to the vat, so that the pulp and water may be heated to
a convenient temperature for working, and an agitator is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
also furnished to keep the pulp and water uniformly
mixed. The mould in which the pulp is raised from the
vat to form a sheet of paper, consists of a wooden frame,
neatly joined at the corners, with wooden bars running
across, about 1½ inch apart, and flush with the top edge
of the frame. Across these again, in the length of the
frame, wires are laid, about fifteen or twenty in an inch,
which are placed parallel to each other. A series of
stronger wires are laid along the cross-bars, to which the
other wires are fastened; these give to what is termed
"laid" paper, the ribbed or "water-marked" lines
noticeable in hand-made paper. Upon the mould is fitted
a movable frame, called the <em>deckle</em> or <em>deckel</em>, which must
fit very neatly or the edges of the paper will be rough.
The mould and deckle form together a kind of shallow
tray of wire. Sometimes the mould is divided by narrow
ribs of wood, so that two or four sheets of paper may be
made in one operation. Connected with the vat is a slanting
board, called the <em>bridge</em>, with copper fillets attached
lengthwise upon it, so that the mould may slide easily
along the bridge.</p>


<p><b>Making the Paper.</b>&mdash;When preparing for work, the vat-man
stands on one side of the vat, and has on his left hand
a smaller board, one end of which is fastened to the bridge,
while the other rests on the side of the vat. An assistant,
called the <em>coucher</em>, is at hand, whose duty it is to handle
the frames or moulds containing the pulp after they
have passed through the hands of the vat-man or maker.
The latter now takes in his hand a mould, and lays it
upon the deckle; he then dips the mould, with its deckle
in its proper place, into the vat of agitated pulp, and lifts
up as much of the pulp as will form a sheet of paper.
This, as will be readily seen, requires the greatest dexterity,
since the workman has nothing but his sense of
feeling to guide him. It is said, however, that practice
gives him such a nicety of feeling in this respect that he
can make sheet after sheet of the largest-sized drawing
papers with a difference in weight of not more than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
or two grains in any two of them. Great skill is also
required to hold the mould in a perfectly horizontal position,
otherwise during the felting and settling of the pulp
the sheet of paper would be thicker on one part than
another. The mould being held lengthwise, that is, with
the long parallel wires running from right to left hand, he
gives the mould a gentle shake from his chest forward
and back again, which is called the <em>fore-right shake</em>; this
shake takes place across the wires, not in the direction of
their length. He next gives a shake from right to left,
and back again, the respective movements thus propelling
the pulp in four directions. The vat-man now pushes the
mould along the small board on his left, and removes the
deckle, which he connects to another mould and proceeds
to form another sheet of paper, and so on. The coucher,
taking the first mould in hand, turns it upside down upon
a piece of woollen felt-cloth, then removing the mould,
he takes another piece of felt and lays it over the sheet
and returns the mould by pushing it along the bridge to
the vat-man, when he receives in return a second mould
to be treated as before.</p>

<p>In the above way felts and paper are laid alternately
until a pile of six or eight quires is produced, which is
afterwards submitted to pressure in a very powerful press.
When sufficiently compressed, the machine is relaxed,
and the felts are then drawn out, on the opposite side,
by an operative, called a <em>layer</em>, who places the felts one by
one upon a board, and the sheets of paper upon another
board. The coucher then uses the felts again for further
operations. Two men and a boy only are employed
in this part of the work. In the evening all the paper
made during the day is put into another press, and subjected
to moderate pressure to obliterate the felt marks
and expel a further portion of the water. On the following
day the paper is all separated, which is called
<em>parting</em>, again pressed, and is then transferred to the
drying-loft. The drying is effected by suspending the
sheets of paper upon a series of ropes, attached to wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
supports; ropes of cow-hair are used for the purpose, as
this material does not stain the paper.</p>


<p><b>Sizing and Finishing.</b>&mdash;When the paper is dry, it is
taken down and laid carefully in heaps ready for sizing,
which is the next operation to which the paper is subjected.
The preparation of the size from animal skins,
etc., is described in Chapter XI. When preparing to
size the paper, the workman takes several quires of the
paper, and carefully spreads the sheets out in the liquid
size, which is placed in a large tub, taking care that each
sheet is uniformly moistened before introducing the next.
The superfluous size is afterwards pressed out, and the
paper then "parted" into separate sheets, which are
again subjected to pressure, and finally transferred to the
drying-room, where they are allowed to dry slowly. When
dry, the paper is conveyed to the finishing-house, to be
again pressed and looked over by women, who, being
furnished with small knives, pick out knots and other
imperfections and separate the perfect from the imperfect
sheets. The paper is now again pressed, and then
handed to the finisher, to be counted into reams and packed,
the reams being afterwards pressed and finally tied up
and conveyed to the warehouse for sale. When the paper
is required to be hot-pressed, this is done by placing each
sheet of paper alternately between two smoothed sheets of
pasteboard, and between each group of fifty pasteboards
is placed a hot plate of iron, and the pile then submitted
to heavy pressure, whereby the surface of writing paper
acquires a fine, smooth surface.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>The Fourdrinier Machine.</b>&mdash;It is just ninety years since
Louis Robert, a Frenchman, devised a machine for making
a continuous web of paper on an endless wire-cloth, to
which rotary motion was applied, thus producing a sheet
of paper of indefinite length. The idea was subsequently
improved upon by Messrs. Fourdrinier, who adopted and
improved upon M. Robert's machine, and with the valuable
aid of Mr. Bryan Donkin, a young and gifted machinist,
in the employ of Mr. Hall, engineer, of Dartford, constructed
a self-acting machine, or working model, in 1803,
which, from its effectiveness and general excellency of
workmanship, created at the time a profound sensation.
This machine was erected at Frogmore, Hertfordshire;
and in 1804 a second machine was made and put up at
Two-Waters, Herts, which was completely successful, and
the manufacture of continuous paper became one of the
most useful and important inventions of the age. From
that period the "Fourdrinier," with some important improvements
introduced by Mr. Donkin, gradually, but
surely, became established as an absolutely indispensable
machine in every paper-mill all over the world. Although
the machine has been still further improved from time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
time, those of recent construction differ but little in principle
from the original machine. An illustration of the
machine is shown in Fig. 25, the detailed parts of which
are expressed on the engraving.</p>


<p><b>Bertrams' Large Paper Machine.</b>&mdash;The principal aim
in the construction of the paper-making machine has been
to imitate, and in some particulars to improve, the operations
involved in the art of making paper by hand, but apart
from the greater width and length of paper which can be
produced by the machine, the increased rapidity of its
powers of production are so great that one machine can
turn out as much paper in three minutes as could be
accomplished by the older system in as many weeks. The
drawing represents the modern paper-machine as manufactured
by Bertrams, Limited, who supplied one of these
machines to Mr. Edward Lloyd, for the <em>Daily Chronicle</em>
Mill, at Sittingbourne, which runs a wire 40 feet long by
126 inches wide, this being, we believe, the largest and
widest paper-machine in the world. It is provided with 20
cylinders, chilled calenders, double-drum reeling motion,
with slitting appliance for preparing webs to go direct to
the printer's office without the assistance of a re-reeling
machine, and is driven by a pair of coupled condensing
steam-engines. On our recent visit to Mr. Lloyd's mill
we were much struck with the excellent working of this
splendid machine.</p>

<p>In the illustration, as will be seen, there are two sets of
drying cylinders, while small cylinders, or felt drying-rolls,
from 16 to 24 inches in diameter, are introduced to the
felts of the cylinders, before the smoothing-rolls, which
discharge the moisture with which the felts are impregnated
from the damp paper, whereby a considerable saving
in felts is effected. Messrs. Bertram state that the highest
speed yet attained has been by their own machinery, and
is 270 feet of paper per minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_135.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 25.</div>
</div>

<p>The progress of the pulp after it leaves the beating-engines
for conversion into paper may be described as
follows:&mdash;The valve at the bottom of the beating-engine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
is opened, when the pulp flows through a pipe into the
stuff-chests, which are generally situated below the level
of the engines. The beaters are then rinsed with clean
water to remove any pulp that may still cling to them,
the rinsing water passing also into the stuff-chests.</p>


<p><b>Stuff-chests.</b>&mdash;These are large vessels of a cylindrical
form, so that the pulp may have no corners to lodge in,
and are generally made of wood, though sometimes they
are made of cast-iron plates bolted together. The chests
are of various dimensions, according to the requirements
of the mill, being usually about 12 feet in diameter and
6 feet deep, having a capacity for 1,000 to 1,200 lbs. of
stuff. To keep the pulp well mixed in the stuff-chest, of
which two are usually employed for each machine, a vertical
shaft, carrying two horizontal arms, each extending
nearly across the interior of the chest, are provided, which
are only allowed to revolve at a moderate speed, that is,
about two or three revolutions per minute, otherwise the
pulp would be liable to work up into knots, and thus form
a defective paper. Motion being given to the shaft, the
rotating arms keep the pulp and water uniformly mixed,
at the same time preventing the pulp from sinking to the
bottom of the stuff-chest.</p>

<p>The pulp is next transferred to a regulating box, or
"supply box," by means of a pump called the <em>stuff-pump</em>.
The regulating-box, which has the effect of keeping a
regular supply of pulp in the machine, is provided with
two overflow pipes, which carry back to the stuff-chests
any superfluous pulp that may have entered them, by
which the stuff in the regulating-box is kept at a uniform
level, while the machine is supplied with a regular
and uniform quantity of the diluted pulp. The stuff-pump
conveys the pulp through a valve in the bottom of
the regulating-box in a greater quantity than is actually
required, the superfluity returning to the stuff-chests by
the overflow pipes; thus the supply-box, being always
kept full, furnishes a regular and uniform supply of pulp
to the sand-tables, or sand-traps as they are sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
called. <em>Sand-tables</em> are large wooden troughs, varying
in size at different mills, but Mr. Dunbar gives the
following proportions for a first-class sand-trap; namely,
14 feet long by 8 feet wide, and 8 inches deep. The
bottom of the trap is covered with felt, sometimes old first-press
felt being used, and is divided into several compartments
by thin bars of lead or iron, or strips of wood,
which keep the felt in position, and also retain any particles
of sand or other heavy solid matter that may be
accidentally present in the pulp. For the purpose of
diluting the pulp for the machine, there is, attached to
the inlet of the sand-traps, a box with two supply-taps,
one for the delivery of pulp, and the other for water;
and these being turned on, the pulp and water flow over
the sand-traps, and the diluted pulp then falls into the
strainers, which, while allowing the fine pulp to pass
freely, keep back all lumps of twisted fibre, and particles
of unboiled fibre, which latter, if not removed, would
appear as specks on the surface of the finished paper.</p>


<p><b>The Strainers</b> are formed of brass or bronze plates, in
which are cut a very large number of narrow slits, which
gradually widen downward, so as to prevent the pulp from
lodging. Each plate has about 510 slits, and several
plates, connected together by bolts, constitutes the complete
strainer. When in use, the strainer receives a
jogging motion, which is communicated to it by means
of small ratchet wheels keyed on shafts passing beneath
the machine; this causes the fibres to pass more
freely through the slits. There are many different forms
of strainers, which have been the subject of numerous
patents. It will be sufficient, however, to give one or two
examples of improved strainers which have been more
recently adopted by manufacturers.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Revolving Strainer and Knotter.</b>&mdash;The revolving
strainer, which was invented by the late senior partner in
the firm of Messrs. G. and W. Bertram (now Bertrams,
Limited), has since been extensively adopted, and the
present firm have introduced a patent knotter in conjunction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with the apparatus, the complete arrangement of which
is shown in Fig. 26. The standard size for these revolving
strainers is 7 feet long by 18⅜ inches wide on each
side of the four surfaces. The vats are of cast iron, and
the apparatus is supplied with driving gear, bellows, regulating
boxes and spouts, as necessary. The firm also supply
these strainers with White's patent discs, and Annandale
and Watson's arrangement. <span class="fs70">A A</span> are two revolving
strainers, as applied to the paper-machine, showing gearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
for strainers and bellows. <span class="fs70">B</span> is the patent knotter as
used for two strainers. <span class="fs70">C</span> is the counter-shaft overhead.
<span class="fs70">D D</span> is the back shaft of the machine, and <span class="fs70">E E</span> the wire of
the paper-machine.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_139.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 27.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Self-cleansing Strainer.</b>&mdash;The same firm also introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
this form of strainer, an illustration of which is
given in Fig. 27. The action of the strainer is described
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The pulp flows on to the strainer at <span class="fs70">A</span>, and passes away
through the pipes <span class="fs70">B B</span>. At <span class="fs70">C</span> is a valve for the discharge
of waste pulp. The strainer plates have an inclination of
about 1 inch in the direction of their length, and in those
which are nearest to <span class="fs70">A</span>, where the pulp enters, the slits are
wider, the knots being pushed forward by the energy of
the flow. The vacuum pumps, <span class="fs70">D D</span>, are worked from the
shaft <span class="fs70">E</span>. The tubes <span class="fs70">F F</span> are for supplying water to the
plates, by which the coarser particles of the pulp are
pushed forward, and the slits are thus kept clean. The
strainer will pass from 18 to 20 tons of the finest paper
per week.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Roeckner's Pulp Strainers.</b>&mdash;This invention consists in
constructing boxes, with one or both ends open, forming
the strainers, fixed, or to slide in or out, so as to be readily
cleaned. One or more fans are fitted in these boxes, and
are put in motion from the outside, so as to cause what is
called "suction" through the strainers. One or a number
of such boxes are fixed into a vat, the open ends discharging
the pulp which has passed through the strainers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to the paper-machine, and can be so arranged that all the
fans are worked on one shaft. The vat may be divided
into compartments, so that the stuff flows from one to the
other. Instead of boxes, the strainers may be formed of
tubes, in which suitable slits or perforations have been
provided. The tubes will be perfectly closed at one end,
and the strained pulp, after passing through them, will be
delivered to the paper-machine from their open ends,
which may fit into a ring, so that when cleaning is required
they may be easily lifted out or in. The suction is
provided inside these tubes by the fans, which are oscillated
by suitable gear from the outside of the vat. The strainers
may, instead of being stationary, be attached to the fans
and oscillate with them, in which case the open ends
would have to be attached to the vat by an indiarubber or
cloth ring, or the strainers may oscillate whilst the fans
are stationary. Any number of these strainers may be
fixed into vats, disposed vertically or otherwise. In the
vat <span class="fs70">A</span>, Fig. 28, which receives the pulp to be strained, are
several tubes, <em>p p p</em>, with one end open, having slits in them
similar to strainer plates. Inside of these are two, three, or
more plates, <em>f f f</em>, Fig. 29, running the full length of the
tube fixed to the shafts, <em>s s s</em>, and to the sides of the tubes,
which serve as fans, besides giving strength to the tubes.
The shafts <em>s s s</em> are carried in bearings at each end, and
have each one end projecting through, upon which are
keyed levers, <em>h h h</em>, which, being connected to a rod <em>r</em>,
worked by an eccentric, <em>e</em>, at the end, gives an oscillating
motion to the tubes and fans. Any number of tubes may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
be in the vat, and may either work separately or divided.
With several tubes it is preferable to have them arranged
as shown in the drawing by division plate <em>d</em>, so that the
accumulated "knots," &amp;c., may flow finally into the end
compartment (which will form an auxiliary strainer), and
may be mixed with more water, so that the fine pulp still
contained in the stuff can flow away through the slits and
the knots, &amp;c., be taken out when necessary. The tubes
should be placed so far apart that a workman can get his
hand between. The closed ends work free in the stuff,
while the open ends run through indiarubber sheet or
other material, fitted so well to the tube that the fibre can
only get through the slits of the tube to flow on to the
paper-machine through the channel at side by the sluice <em>v</em>.
The arrows indicate the direction of the flow of pulp.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_142.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 30.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Dunbar says, "the straining power necessary to
pass and clean pulp in an efficient manner for 25 tons of
finished paper per week is two revolving strainers, consisting
of four rows of plates, or 7 feet by 18 inches of
straining surface on each of the four sides, the plates
being cut No. 2½ Watson's gauge."</p>

<p>After passing through the strainers the pulp should be
absolutely free from knots or objectionable particles of
any kind, and in a proper condition for conversion into
paper.</p>


<p><b>The Machine Wire and its Accessories.</b>&mdash;On leaving
the strainers the pulp passes into a vat, in which is a
horizontal agitator, which causes the pulp and water to
become well mixed, and ready to flow on to the endless
wire-cloth of the machine. The wire-cloth is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of exceedingly fine wire, the meshes ranging from 60
threads and upwards to the inch, there being sometimes
as many as 1,900 holes per square inch, but the
meshes usually employed run from 2,000 to 6,000 per
square inch. The ends of the cloth are united by being
sewn with very fine wire. The width of the wire-cloth
varies considerably, the greatest width being, we believe,
that supplied for the large machine at Mr. Edward
Lloyd's mill at Sittingbourne, which is 126 inches. The
length of the wire-cloth is generally from 35 to 40 feet,
the latter being considered preferable. Beneath the wire
is placed a shallow box called the "save-all," which
receives the water as it flows through the wire cloth from
the pulp. In order to effect a further saving of pulp
which escapes through the meshes of the wire-cloth, a
machine called a "pulp-saver" is used at some mills,
through which the backwater, as it leaves the box or
save-all referred to, is passed.</p>

<p>The wire-cloth is supported by a series of brass tube
rolls, which are so placed as to render the layer of pulp
on the wire absolutely uniform, by which a regular thickness
of the finished paper is ensured. The wire is attached
to a malleable iron frame, having a sole-plate of cast iron,
and carries a brass or copper breast-roll, 18 inches in
diameter, a guide-roll 7 inches in diameter, and four brass
or copper rolls 5 inches in diameter under the wire, with
shafts extending through the rolls, and furnished with
brass bushes and brackets, and a self-acting guide upon
the 7-inch guide-roll. The tube-rolls or "carrying tubes"
are carried upon brass bearings. Attached to the sole-plate
of the wire framing are three cast-iron stands on
each side for supporting the save-all beneath the wire.
To regulate the width of the paper there is on the top of
the wire a set of brass "deckles," carried on a brass frame
passing over the first suction box, of which there are two,
and supported on the wire frame by iron studs fixed in
the frame. At each end of the deckle-frame is a pulley
for carrying the deckle-strap, with three similar pulleys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
for expanding it. The deckle-frame is furnished with
two endless straps of india-rubber, these straps keeping
the pulp to the width required for forming ledges at the
sides of the web.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Conical Pulp-saver</b>, which is shown in Fig. 31, was
invented by the late Mr. George Bertram and Mr. Paisley,
and is manufactured by Bertrams, Limited. Its use is to
extract fibres from the washing water before going into
the river or otherwise. For the water from the drum-washer,
washing and beating engines, and for the water
from the paper-making machine, save-all, &amp;c., it has
proved itself of great utility. It is simple in construction,
small in cost, takes up little room, and is easily
repaired. When placed to receive the washings from the
beaters or paper-machine, the pulp saved, if kept clean,
can always be re-used. <span class="fs70">A</span> is a conical drum which is
covered with wire-cloth, and it is made to revolve slowly
by suitable gearing. The water enters by the pipe <span class="fs70">B</span>,
which is perforated, as shown, and passes through the
meshes of the gauze, while the pulp gradually finds its
way to the wider end of the drum, where it escapes into
the box <span class="fs70">C</span>, and can be conveyed again to the beating-engines.</p>

<p><b>The Dandy-roll.</b>&mdash;When it is required to produce a
design or name, termed a <em>water-mark</em>, upon the paper, this
is done by means of a roll called the <em>dandy-roll</em>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
consists of a skeleton roll covered with wire-cloth, upon
which the design is worked by means of very fine wire.
If the paper is required to be alike on both sides, without
any specific pattern or name upon it, the roll is simply
covered with wire-cloth, the impressions from which upon
the moist pulp correspond with those of the machine-wire
on the under surface. By this means paper known as
"wove" paper is produced. A dandy-roll of this character
is shown in Fig. 32. "Laid" paper, as it is
termed, is distinguished by a dandy-roll having a series
of equidistant transverse wires on the upper surface of
the wire cylinder, as shown in Fig. 33, the effect of which
is to produce parallel lines on the paper, caused by the
pulp being thinner where the moist paper is impressed by
the raised wires, which renders the lines more transparent
than the rest of the paper. The dandy-roll, which is
usually about 7 inches in diameter, corresponds in length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to the width of wire on which it rests, and is placed over
the wire-cloth between the suction-boxes. The journals
of the roll turn in slits in two vertical stands, one behind
the machine frame and the other in front of it. The roll,
however, rests with its whole weight on the wire, and
revolves by the progressive motion of the wire. The
stands which support the roll prevent it from being
influenced by the lateral motion of the wire. By thus
running over the surface of the pulp when the wire is in
motion, this roll presses out a considerable quantity of
water, at the same time rendering the paper closer and
finer in texture. Dandy-rolls of various lengths, and
bearing different designs or patterns, are kept at the paper-mills,
and great care is exercised to preserve them from
injury.</p>


<p><b>Water-Marking.</b>&mdash;Dr. Ure describes the following processes
for producing a design for a line water-mark:&mdash;1.
The design is engraved on some yielding surface in the
same way as on a copper-plate, and afterwards, by immersing
the plate in a solution of copper sulphate, and
producing an electrotype in the usual way, by which all
the interstices become so filled up as to give a casting of
pure copper. This casting, on being removed from the
sulphate bath, is ready for attaching to the wire gauze
of the dandy-roll. 2. The design is first engraved on a
steel die, the parts required to give the greatest effect
being cut deepest; the die, after being hardened, is forced
by a steam hammer into some yielding material, such as
copper, and all of this metal which remains above the
plain surface of the steel is subsequently removed by
suitable means; the portion representing the design being
left untouched would then be attached to the wire-gauze
as before. Light and shade can be communicated to the
mark by a modification of the above process, for which
purpose an electrotype of the raised surface of a design
is first taken, and afterwards a second electrotype from
this latter, which consequently will be identical with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the original surface. These two are then mounted on
lead or gutta-percha, and employed as dies to give impression
to fine copper-wire gauze, which is then employed as
a mould. Thus absolute uniformity, such as could not be
attained by the old system of stitching wires together, is
now attained in bank-notes by the adoption of the above
method. It may be mentioned that when the moulds
were formed by stitching the fine wires together to form
a design, no less than 1,056 wires, with 67,584 twists,
and involving some hundreds of thousands of stitches,
were required to form a pair of £5 note moulds, and it
was obviously impossible that the designs should remain
absolutely identical.</p>

<p>Sometimes water-marks are produced by depressing the
surface of the dandy-roll in the form of a design, which
causes the paper to be thicker where the design is than
in the rest of the sheet of paper. This modification was
invented by Dr. De la Rue.</p>


<p><b>De La Rue's Improvements in Water-marks.</b>&mdash;By
one method, patented in 1869, dandy-rolls, having a surface
of embossed wire-gauze, are used; the indentations
in the gauze are inwards, causing a thickening of the
paper where they are brought in contact with it. These
thickenings correspond in form to the configuration of the
design or water-mark. The inventor has also affixed wire
to the surface of such dandy-rolls so as to form projections,
in order to thin the paper where the projections
come in contact with it, by which means light lines are
obtained in the water-mark, strengthening the effect of
the thickened opaque design.</p>

<p>By another patent, dated May, 1884, No. 8348, the
inventor forms the surface of the dandy-roll of wire-gauze
embossed in such a manner that parts of the
surface of the gauze, corresponding to the configuration
of the design of the water-mark, are raised, and
project out from the general surface, and other parts
corresponding to the line shading of the design are depressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
below the level of the general surface. The accompanying
drawing, Fig. 34, shows diagrammatically, and
greatly enlarged, a section of a portion of the surface of a
dandy-roll made in accordance with this invention. <em>a</em>
represents the section of a ridge or projection raised on
the surface of the gauze; <em>b</em> represents the section of a
groove or depression in the wire-gauze, which, with other
similar grooves, serves to produce an opaque shading to
the design. <em>c</em> is an auxiliary ridge or projection, serving
to define the shading line, and to intensify it by driving
the pulp into the groove or depression <em>b</em>. Further effects
may be obtained by attaching wires to the dandy-roll,
either in the usual way, where the surface is unembossed,
or upon the raised parts <em>a</em>, which give the configuration
to the water-mark. In place of forming the ridges or
projections <em>a</em>, which produce the configuration of the
water-mark, by raising portions of the wire-gauze above
the general surface, they may be formed by sewing on
suitably shaped slips of wire-gauze, or of sheet metal perforated
all over with fine holes, on to the surface of the gauze
which is embossed with the grooves <em>b</em>, but it is much to be
preferred that both the ridges <em>a</em> and the grooves <em>b</em> should
be produced by embossing the gauze. Water-marks may
also be produced by placing sheets of finished paper in
contact with plates of copper or zinc, bearing a design in
relief, and submitting them to heavy pressure.</p>

<p><b>Suction-Boxes.</b>&mdash;These boxes, which are fitted under
the wire, are made of wood, and are open at the top, the
edges being lined with vulcanite. The ends of the boxes
are movable, so that they may be adjusted to suit the
width of the paper required; they are also provided with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
air-cocks for regulating the vacuum, which is obtained by
means of two sets of vacuum pumps, having three 6-inch
barrels to each set:
a vacuum pump of
this form is shown
in Fig. 35. As the
wire travels over
these boxes, the action
of the pumps
draws the wire upon
them with sufficient
pressure to render
them air-tight; by
this means a large
portion of the water
which the pulp still
retains at this point
becomes extracted,
thereby giving to
it such a degree of
consistency that it
can stand the pressure
of the couch-rolls
without injury.
The backwater
extracted by
the suction-boxes,
as also that collected
in the save-all,
is added to a
fresh supply of
pulp before it flows on to the sand-tables.</p>


<p><b>Couch-Rolls.</b>&mdash;At the extreme end of the wire-cloth
from the breast-roll, and inside the wire, is the under
couch-roll, from which the wire receives its motion. This
roll, which is of brass, is usually about 14 inches in diameter,
is carried upon a cast-iron framing with brass
bearings, and is ground to a working joint with the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
roll, which is also of brass, and 20 inches in diameter. Both
these rolls are covered with a seamless coating of woollen
felt. The upper roll rests upon the lower one, and the
wire-cloth, and the web of paper upon it, pass between the
rolls, receiving gentle pressure, by which the paper becomes
deprived of more water, rendering it still more compact.
It is at this stage that the web of paper leaves the
wire-cloth, and passes on to a continuously revolving and
endless web of woollen felt, termed the "wet felt," from
the moist condition of the paper. This felt, which is carried
on wooden rollers, is about 20 feet long, and is manufactured
with considerable care.</p>


<p><b>The Press-Rolls.</b>&mdash;The paper now passes on to the
<em>first press-rolls</em>, which deprive it of a still further quantity
of water, and put it in a condition to bear gentle handling
without injury. The upper roll is fitted with a contrivance
termed the "doctor," which keeps the roll clean by removing
fragments of paper that may have become attached to
it. The doctor is furnished with a knife which passes
along the entire length of the roll, pressing against it from
end to end. These rolls are generally of iron, jacketed
with brass, the under one being 14 inches in diameter, and
the top roll 16 inches. Sometimes this roll is made of fine-grained
cast-iron. When the roll is of iron the doctor
blade is steel; but when this roll is brass the knife is of
the same material. The under surface of the paper, which
has been in contact with the felt, and necessarily being in
a moist condition, receives more or less an impression
from the felt over which it travelled, while the upper surface,
on the other hand, will have been rendered smooth
by the pressure of the top roll of the first press. To
modify this, and to render both surfaces of the paper as
nearly uniform as possible, the paper passes through
another set of rolls, termed the <em>second press-rolls</em>, in
which the paper becomes reversed, which is effected by
causing it to enter at the back of the rolls, which rotate in
a reverse direction to those of the first press, by which
the under or wire side of the paper comes in contact with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the top roll of the press. By this arrangement the underside
of the paper is rendered equally smooth with the
upper surface. The second set of press-rolls is provided
with an endless felt of its own, which is usually both
stronger and thicker than that used in connection with the
first press-rolls. In some mills each set of press-rolls is
provided with a doctor, to prevent the web of paper from
adhering to the metal. Sometimes the doctor knives
are made from vulcanite, a material which would seem
specially suited for a purpose of this kind. From this
point the paper passes to the first set of drying cylinders.</p>


<p><b>The Drying Cylinders.</b>&mdash;The invention of the steam
drying cylinder is due to Mr. T. B. Crompton, who, in
the year 1821, obtained a patent for this useful addition
to the paper-machine. Since that period, however, the
system of drying the paper by steam-heat has been brought
to a high state of perfection; not only this, but the number
of cylinders has gradually increased, while the heat to which
they are raised has proportionately decreased, and as a consequence
the size, which is injuriously affected by rapid drying,
is gradually deprived of its moisture, and thus renders
the paper closer and stronger, while at the same time a
very rapid speed can be maintained. The drying cylinders
in the machine shown in the engraving are 4 feet in diameter
and 12 in number, being arranged in two groups of
8 and 4 cylinders respectively, and in the aggregate present
a very large drying surface, it being very important that the
operation should be effected gradually, more especially at
its earlier stages. There is a passage between the second
press-roll and the cylinders, through which the machine-men
can pass from one side of the machine to the other.
The first two or three of the first section of cylinders are
only moderately heated, and having no felt on them, allow
the moisture from the paper to escape freely. The next five
cylinders, however, are provided with felts, which press
the paper against the heated surfaces, by which it becomes
smooth and flattened, thus putting it into a proper
condition for passing between the <em>smoothing-rolls</em>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
cylinders are heated by steam, and are generally of decreasing
diameter, to
allow for the shrinking
of the paper during
the drying.</p>


<p><b>Smoothing-Rolls.</b>&mdash;These
consist of
highly polished cast-iron
rolls, heated by
steam. The paper
being in a somewhat
moist condition when
it passes through
these rolls, they have
the effect of producing
a fine smooth
surface.</p>

<p>The paper next
passes over the last four drying
cylinders, all being provided
with felts, to keep the paper
closely pressed against their
heating surfaces, by which the
remaining moisture becomes expelled
and the paper rendered
perfectly dry. The paper now
passes through the calender
rolls, and is then wound on to
reels at the extreme end of the
machinery. The operation of
calendering will be treated in
the next chapter.</p>

<p><b>Single Cylinder Machine.</b>&mdash;For
the manufacture of thin
papers, as also for papers which
are required to be glazed on
one side only, a single cylinder machine, called the
Yankee machine, has been introduced, a representation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of which is shown in Fig. 36. It is constructed on the
same principle as the larger Fourdrinier machine up
to the couching-rolls, when the paper leaves the wire-cloth
and passes on to an endless felt running round the top
couch-roll, and passes from thence to a large drying
cylinder, which is about 10 feet in diameter and heated
by steam, the surface of which is highly polished, giving
to the surface of the paper in contact with it a high gloss.
There is attached to the machine an arrangement for
washing the felt for the purpose of cooling and opening
it out after passing through a cold press-roll and the hot
drying cylinder. This machine, as manufactured by
Messrs. Bentley and Jackson, for cap, skip, and thin papers,
consists of a rocking frame, and wrought-iron side bars,
fitted with brass bearings, the necessary brass and copper
tube-rolls, couch-rolls, with driving shaft, stands and
pulley; self-acting wire guide, brass deckle sides and
pulleys, brass slice, vacuum boxes, pipes and cocks; wet
felt frame, with the necessary water pipes and cocks, and
carriages to carry the couch-rolls and felt-rolls; the
necessary wet felt-rolls and a felt washing apparatus; one
bottom press-roll carried by brass steps, and fitted with
compound levers and weight; one large cast-iron drying
cylinder about 10 feet in diameter, and fitted with a central
shaft, steam admission and water delivery nozzles, two
water lifters and pipes, a manhole and vacuum valve, a
large spur driving wheel, spur pinion, driving shaft and
pulley; massive cast-iron framework, with pedestals to
carry the cylinder; traversing steel doctor and frames;
copper leading roll and carriages, a pair of reeling stands
fitted with brass steps, friction pulleys and plates, regulating
screws, etc.; a wooden platform and iron guard rail,
all carried by strong cast-iron framing; the necessary pulp
and backwater pumps, shake, knotter, stuff chests, service
cistern, pipes and valves, shafting, pedestals, change
wheels, pulleys, &amp;c. These machines can be obtained of
any desired width.</p>

<p class="noindent">To impart a higher gloss, or, as it is technically termed
"glaze," to paper after it leaves the machine, it has to be
subjected to further calendering, which is accomplished
either in the web, or in sheets, according to the quality of
the paper.</p>


<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_b_155a.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 37.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Web-Glazing.</b>&mdash;<em>Glazing Calender.</em>&mdash;When paper has to
be glazed in the web, it is passed between a series of rolls,
which are constructed upon several different systems. In
one form of this machine the rolls are alternately of finely
polished iron, and compressed paper, or cotton, the iron
rolls being bored hollow to admit of their being connected
to steam pipes, for heating them when necessary. In this
machine there are eight rolls, the centre pair being both
paper rolls, which have an effect equivalent to reversing the
paper, by which both sides are made alike. Another form
of glazing calender, of American origin, but which has
been improved upon by our own engineers, consists of a
stack of rolls made from chilled iron, the surfaces of
which are ground and finished with exquisite precision
upon a system adopted in America. A representation of
this calender as manufactured by Messrs. Bentley and
Jackson is given in Fig. 37. Such rolls as require heating
are bored through, and their ends fitted with brass
junctions and cocks, to regulate the admission of steam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
The standards are of cast iron, planed and fitted with
phosphor bronze bearings; the bearings to carry the top
roll of the stack are furnished
with wrought-iron screws and
hand wheels, and wrought-iron
lifting links can be attached
to raise one or more of the
rolls, according to the finish
required on the paper. Compound
levers are also supplied,
to regulate and adjust the pressure
on the ends of the rolls.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_155b.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 38.</div>
</div>

<p><em>Damping Rolls.</em>&mdash;An important
improvement in connection
with the calendering of paper
was introduced by Messrs. G. and W. Bertram a few
years since, by which a higher finish is given to the
paper than had previously been attainable. This consists
of a damping apparatus <span class="fs70">A</span> (Fig. 38) which is placed
between the last drying cylinders <span class="fs70">B</span> of the machine and
the glazing calenders <span class="fs70">C</span>. The damping-rolls consist of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
two brass or copper rolls, about 14 inches in diameter,
through which a constant stream of cold water is passed,
while a line of steam jets, issued from finely-perforated
pipes, plays over the face of the rolls. The cold water
within the rolls condenses the steam, thereby imparting
a uniform moisture to the under surface of the paper,
which enables it to take a better surface when passing
through the glazing rolls. The steam-pipes can be regulated
so as to give any amount of dampness required by
adjusting the steam cocks accordingly. By reference to
the engraving, it will be observed from the disposition of
the rolls that the web of paper is reversed, thus equalising
the moisture on both sides, by which the paper-maker is
enabled to produce an evenly-finished paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_156.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 39.</div>
</div>

<p>The chilled-iron glazing-rolls, as originally introduced,
were fitted up in stacks of seven, and sometimes as many
as nine rolls, but it was found in practice that so large
a number of rolls gave unsatisfactory results; the heavy
pressure, acting on the paper immediately after leaving the
drying cylinders, had the effect of "crushing" the paper,
giving it a thin feel. It is now considered preferable to
use calenders having not more than four, or at most five
rolls. An arrangement of this description, manufactured
by Bertrams, is represented in Fig. 39. The system
recommended by Mr. Dunbar is to employ three sets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
rolls, disposed as follows:&mdash;"First, a set of three rolls;
second, a set to consist of four rolls, and a stack of five to
give the finishing or dry surface. With this arrangement
of calenders, and the assistance of the damping apparatus,
any desired surface can be got by varying and regulating
the drying of the paper, which any careful machine-man
can do with ordinary attention."</p>


<p><b>Finishing.</b>&mdash;To give a still higher finish to the paper,
it is subjected to what is termed "friction-glazing," which
consists in passing it through a stack of rolls, formed
alternately of small iron rolls and larger paper ones, the
iron rolls revolving at a much higher speed than the
paper-rolls. The effect of this final glazing operation
gives the paper a very fine surface.</p>


<p><b>Plate-Glazing.</b>&mdash;<em>Donkin's Glazing Press.</em>&mdash;This term,
which is also called "super-calendering," is applied to a
method of glazing hand-made paper, and is also adopted
for the better qualities of machine-made paper. It consists
in placing sheets of paper between highly polished
plates of either copper or zinc, the latter being more
generally used. The metal plates, with the sheets of paper
placed alternately between them, are made up into packs
or "handfuls" (the operation being usually performed by
women), and these are passed between two powerful rolls,
giving a pressure of from twenty to thirty tons, and each
pack, consisting of about forty plates and as many sheets,
is passed through the rolls several times, the pressure being
regulated by means of screws or levers and weights acting
on the ends of the top roll. A machine for glazing paper
in packs, manufactured by Messrs. Bryan Donkin and Co.,
is shown in Fig. 40. Some descriptions of paper, as
"antique" and "old style," for example, are surfaced with
good cardboard instead of copper or zinc plates. As soon
as the handful has passed through the rollers, the motion
of the machine is reversed, by which means the pack is
made to pass forwards and backwards repeatedly, according
to the extent of gloss or smoothness required.</p>

<p><b>Mr. Wyatt on American Super-calendering.</b>&mdash;Mr. Wyatt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
on a recent visit to America, had many
opportunities of witnessing the systems of manufacture
adopted there, and subsequently delivered an interesting
address to the members of the Paper-Makers' Club,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> in
which he acknowledged the superiority of the high-class
printing papers for book-work, which has so often been
the subject of recognition in this country. Indeed, if we
compare the surface of the paper used even for ordinary
technical journals in America and that generally adopted
for our own periodicals of a similar class, we are constrained
to admit that the difference is in favour of our
transatlantic competitors. "In the manufacture of high-class
super-calendered printing papers," Mr. Wyatt observes,
"for fine book-work, or as they call them book
papers, the Americans certainly excel. Whether this be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
due to the kind of raw material used, to the almost universal
use of the refining-engine, which renders the pulp
very soft and mellow, or to the state of perfection to
which they have brought the art of super-calendering, or
perhaps due to all three, I could not exactly determine.
The material generally used for this class of paper is
poplar chemical fibre and waste paper to the extent of
50 per cent., and even up to 75 and 80 per cent. of the
total fibre, the balance being rags, or, in cheaper qualities,
sulphite wood pulp; the stuff is all mixed together
in large beaters, holding from 800 lbs. up to 1,500 lbs. of
pulp, where it is about half beaten, and then finished in
one or other form of refining-engine.</p>

<p>"The Americans have, I think, more thoroughly studied
the question of super-calendering paper than we, and in
this respect get better results and better work. The paper
is mostly slit and trimmed on the paper-machine, and
reeled up in from two to four widths by an ingenious
contrivance called the <em>Manning-winder</em>, which automatically
keeps the tension constant on each of the reels,
whatever the diameter, and is super-calendered in narrow
widths on small calenders. These calenders are from
36 inches to 42 inches wide, and consist of a stack of 9
to 11 rolls, alternately chilled iron, and cotton or paper;
the paper is passed through the rolls two or three times,
never less than twice, under great pressure applied by
hand-screws. The power required is very high, being
from 40 to 50 h.p. for each calender, and the speed
from 450 feet up to 600 feet per minute. The paper is
not usually damped before calendering, but is left rather
under-dried from the machine; neither is steam heat used
in the rolls, which get very warm, owing to the high speed
at which they run. The rolls are driven entirely by
straps, the arrangements for the fast and slow speed and
for reeling on and off the paper being well designed and
worked out; the main strap, running at high speed, runs
on a loose pulley on the shaft of the bottom roll, by means
of a powerful friction clutch; this pulley can be made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
tight one. On this same bottom shaft is keyed a multiple
V-shaped grooved friction pulley. Another, and independent
shaft, driven from the main shaft by a crossed
belt, has a small grooved pulley keyed on it, which can
be thrown in and out of gear with the large grooved
pulley. Strap-driving is thus secured throughout, and
the speed can be increased gradually without jerks, from
the starting up to the fastest speed by working the levers,
gearing the friction clutch and pulleys slowly."</p>

<p>In reference to the high finish of American papers, we
are disposed to attribute this mainly to the nature of the
chief raw material used&mdash;wood fibre. In the year 1854,
when specimens of Mr. Charles Watt's wood-fibre paper
were first printed upon, the remarkable gloss of the wood
paper attracted much attention, and it was noticed that
the impression of the ink appeared to be well <em>on the surface
of the paper</em>, and not, as was often the case with
ordinary printing papers of the time, partially absorbed
by the paper itself. Mr. Wyatt states that poplar
chemical fibre and waste paper to the extent of 50 per
cent., and even up to 75 and 80 per cent., are used, the
balance being rags; now since the waste paper in all
probability would be composed largely of wood fibre, and
as, in the cheaper qualities, sulphite wood pulp is used in
lieu of rags, it will be fair to assume that the chief basis
of the highly-finished papers for which the Americans
are justly famous is wood fibre, and we believe that there
is no other variety of cellulose which is so susceptible of
producing a naturally glossy paper as that which is obtained
from wood by the soda process.</p>


<p><b>Mr. Arnot on Finishing.</b>&mdash;Mr. Arnot makes the
following observations respecting the finishing of paper:&mdash;"The
paper may be slit into widths, suitable for
wet calenders, or may be cut up into sheets, and glazed
by the plate or board calenders. The former method of
surfacing or finishing has come extensively into use
in recent times, the labour involved being much less
than in the older method of finishing in sheets. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
however, the plate calenders are kept at work upon
the higher classes of goods, it being possible to give
almost any degree of surface to good paper by that means.
There is little doubt, too, that the paper glazed by the
plate rolls retains its original softness to a greater degree
than that passed through web calenders. In the latter it
is exposed in one thickness to great pressure, and is
thinned in consequence; whereas, when the sheets are
made up into piles, along with copper or zinc plates, there
is a certain amount of spring or elasticity in the treatment
which largely counteracts the crushing action of the rolls.
The web calenders consist of a series of rollers erected in
a vertical frame, and between these the paper winds, beginning
at the top and coming downwards, so that the
pressure gradually increases as the paper moves on its
journey. It will be observed that the under rolls have to
bear the weight of the upper ones, and that consequently
the pressure on the paper will be greater the lower down
it descends. Many of the rollers themselves are now
made of paper, and as these possess a slight degree of
elasticity, and take a high polish, they are alternated with
iron rollers with good effect. The paper-rolls are made
by sliding an immense number of circular sheets, perforated
in the centre, on to an iron core or shaft, pressing
these close together by hydraulic action, and trimming
them off on the lathe. The plate or broad calenders consist
only of two rollers, the upper one heavily weighted,
preferably by compound levers. Between these rollers
the sheets of paper, alternated with plates of copper or
zinc, and made up into bundles about an inch in thickness,
are passed backwards and forwards, the reciprocating
action being produced by the movement of a lever in the
hand of an attendant. The metal and paper sheets of
different bundles may be interchanged, and the process
repeated with the effect of increasing the beauty and
equality of the finish."</p>

<p><b>Cutting.</b>&mdash;<em>Revolving Knife.</em>&mdash;When paper is to be used
in a continuous printing-machine, or, as is often the case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
has to be exported in the web, it is supplied in rolls; otherwise
it is cut into sheets before leaving the mill. The form
of cutter generally used is what is termed the <em>revolving
knife-cutter</em>, an illustration of which, as manufactured by
Bertrams, Limited, is shown in Fig. 41. At <span class="fs70">A</span> is shown
a series of webs, the paper from which is drawn forward
by the rolls, <span class="fs70">B</span>, and is then slit into suitable widths, and
the margin at the same time pared by circular knives, one
of which is shown at <span class="fs70">C</span>. It then passes through a pair of
leading-rolls, after which it comes in contact with a knife,
<span class="fs70">D</span>, attached to a revolving drum, <span class="fs70">E</span>, pressing against a
dead knife not shown in the engraving. The sheets, as
they are thus cut, drop upon a travelling felt or apron, <span class="fs70">F</span>,
from which they are lifted and placed in piles, by boys or
girls standing on each side of the felt. These machines
will cut eight webs at one time.</p>

<p><em>Bertrams' Single-sheet Cutter.</em>&mdash;In cases where it is
necessary that the sheets should be cut with great uniformity,
as in the case of paper bearing a water-mark, in
which it is requisite that the design should appear exactly
in the centre of the sheet, the ordinary cutter is not found
to be sufficiently reliable; a machine termed a "single-sheet cutter"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
is therefore used for this purpose, of which
an illustration is shown in Fig. 42. The paper is led
direct from the paper-machine, or from a reel frame, to
the drawing-in rolls, <span class="fs70">A</span>; after which it passes through the
circular slitting-knives, <span class="fs70">B</span>; from here it is led by the
roller <span class="fs70">C</span> to a large wood-covered drum, <span class="fs70">D</span>, and at the front
of this drum the sheets are cut by the cross-cutting
knives, <span class="fs70">E</span>. There are two cast-iron tapered cones, with
belt guide for adjusting the speed; a fly-wheel to promote
steadiness in working; a series of wrought-iron
levers, cranks, eccentrics, shafts, etc., for accurately regulating
the travel of paper and the cut of the horizontal
knives; a small pasting table is also fitted across the
machine for mending broken sheets.</p>


<p><b>Packing the Finished Paper.</b>&mdash;The paper, after it
leaves the cutting-machine, is conveyed to the <em>finishing-house</em>,
where it is carefully examined by women, who cast
aside all defective or damaged sheets, which, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
trade names of "imperfections" or "retree," are sometimes
disposed of, at a lower rate, to the customer for whom the
order is executed. In the warehouse these imperfections
are marked with a capital R on the wrapper, or two
crosses, thus <span class="nowrap"><b>X X</b>.</span> If the paper is broken, it is sometimes
marked <span class="nowrap">B <b>X X</b>;</span> it is not generally the custom, however,
to sell imperfections, but to return them to the beater-man,
to be re-converted into pulp. The perfect sheets are then
counted, and packed up in reams consisting of 480 to 516
sheets.</p>


<p><b>Sizes of Paper.</b>&mdash;The various sizes of paper are known
in the stationery trade under different designations, as
demy, crown, double crown, royal, imperial, etc. As paper
is generally purchased according to weight, the various
weights per ream are also distinguished with the size of
the paper, as 16 lb. demy, 22 lb. double crown, and so on.
The following table shows the sizes of some of the writing
and printing papers in common use:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Coloured Papers.</b>&mdash;There are several methods by which
any desired shade of colour may be imparted to paper,
which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. By blending with the pulp in the beating-engine
some insoluble substance, such as smalts blue&mdash;a kind of
glass coloured by oxide of cobalt&mdash;ultramarine, yellow
ochre, etc.</p>

<p>2. By adding a coloured liquid, which simply dyes or
stains the fibre.</p>

<p>3. By using rags which are already coloured, in proportions
to give the required shade, in which case of course
the process of bleaching must be omitted.</p>

<p>4. By employing two substances, as yellow prussiate of
potash (ferrocyanide of potassium) and a persalt of iron,
for example, which, when combined, yield the requisite
blue tint&mdash;Prussian blue.</p>

<p>By this latter method the buff shade given to what is
termed <em>toned paper</em> is effected, by using a solution of copperas
(sulphate of iron) and an alkaline solution, or by using
a solution of pernitrate of iron. In experimenting in this
direction we have found that a mixture of solutions of sulphate
of iron and bichromate of potassa produce an agreeable
and permanent buff tint. The solutions may be added
to the pulp alternately, or may be first mixed and then at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
once put into the beater. From 2 to 3 ozs. of each salt
for each gallon of water may be used if the solutions are
to be mixed before using; but when applied separately
the solutions may be used in a more concentrated condition.</p>


<p><b>Colouring Matters used in Paper-Making.</b>&mdash;The following
substances, used either alone or mixed in suitable
proportions, are employed in colouring pulp for paper-making:&mdash;</p>

<div class="p1 textcol">
<p>Smalts blue.</p>

<p>Prussian blue.</p>

<p>Indigo blue.</p>

<p>Aniline blues.</p>

<p>Aniline reds, including eosine.</p>

<p>Cochineal, for pink, etc.</p>

<p>Brazil wood, which imparts either
a fine red or orange-brown
colour, according to the treatment
it has undergone.</p>

<p>Logwood, for violet colours.</p>
</div>

<div class="textcol">
<p>Chrome yellow and orange
chrome.</p>

<p>Orange mineral.</p>

<p>Copperas, for mixing with other
substances.</p>

<p>Venetian red.</p>

<p>Yellow ochre.</p>

<p>Quercitron, or oak-bark.</p>

<p>Nutgalls.</p>

<p>Lamp black.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Blue.</em>&mdash;The coarser kind of paper used for packing is
prepared from rags blued with indigo, which, when reduced
to pulp, are not subjected to the process of bleaching. The
finer kinds of paper are blued in various ways, but the
chief material used is what is known as artificial ultramarine,
of which there are many qualities in the market,
to which reference is made in another chapter. Prussian
blue is also used, but this is usually produced directly in
the beating-engine by adding in solution, 95 parts of sulphate
of iron and 100 parts of ferrocyanide of potassium
(yellow prussiate of potash). Smalts blue, which was formerly
much used before the introduction of artificial ultramarine,
is still preferred for high-classed papers as the
colour is more permanent. To obtain smalts in an exceedingly
fine state of division the best plan is to grind
the colour in a little water, and then to separate the finest
particle by the process of <em>elutriation</em>, that is, by diffusing
the reduced mass through a large volume of water, and
after allowing the larger particles to subside, pouring off
the liquor in which the finer particles are suspended, to a
separate vessel, in which they are allowed to subside. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
this operation is carefully conducted the smalts may be
obtained in an exceedingly fine state of division, and we
have found that in this state the colour blends well with
the pulp, and has little or no disposition to sink through
it, but produces a uniform colouring throughout.</p>

which have been adopted by American manufacturers:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">The above proportions are for 400 lbs. of pulp.</p>

<p>The large proportion of alum prescribed in all the above
examples serves as a mordant, and also, with the addition
of resin soap, for sizing. All the above mixtures should
be passed through a No. 60 wire-cloth into the beating-engine.</p>


<p><b>Mixing Colouring Materials with Pulp.</b>&mdash;It will be
readily understood that when paper is sized in the pulp,
as Mr. Hofmann points out, the resinous alumina surrounds
the fibres and prevents the colouring materials
from penetrating them. In such cases the colouring
materials are only loosely held, and a portion must therefore
be lost in the machine. If added to the pulp before
it is sized they become thoroughly mixed with the fibres,
and with them enveloped by the size. The pulp should
always be coloured before it is sized, except in cases where
the alum or resin soap would injure the colours, or be
injured by them. While the pulp is being sized and
coloured, the finishing touch is given by the engine-man,
who examines it and empties it into the stuff-chest.</p>


<p><b>Colouring Paper for Artificial Flowers.</b>&mdash;Davis gives
the following recipes for colouring one ream of paper of
medium weight and size, sap colours only being used, and
principally those containing much colouring matter. The

<p class="noindent"><b>Waterproof Paper.</b>&mdash;<em>Scoffern and Tidcombe's Process.</em>&mdash;In
this process, for which a patent was granted in 1875,
the well-known solubility of cellulose in cupro-ammonium
is taken advantage of, for the purpose of producing waterproof
paper by destroying its absorptive properties. After
the paper is made and dried in the usual way by the paper-making
machine, it is led through a bath of cupro-ammonium,
having a roll or rollers therein, or in connection
therewith, either on reels on which the paper is reeled, or
from the continuous web of paper itself directly from the
machine, and from this bath it is led over a table of wire-cloth,
or india-rubber, or over a series of rollers forming a
table, under which steam-pipes are placed for the purpose of
"setting," or partially drying, the web; it is then led over
suitable reels in a hot-air chamber to season or finish the
treated paper, which is then cut as the paper runs, by the
ordinary cutting machine, into the required sheets. The
chamber in which the paper is treated is ventilated as
follows:&mdash;Over the bath and hot-air chamber is another
chamber having openings leading into the hot-air chamber,
and at these openings a steam-blast, or fan-blast, is
applied, which ventilates the chamber in which the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
is heated, and drives the ammonia into contact with either
sulphurous or hydrochloric acid, and by this means the
ammonia is recovered in a solid form which would otherwise
be wasted.</p>

<p>The inventors also incorporate hydrated oxide of copper
with paper pulp, so that after it is made into paper it has
only to be subjected to the action of ammonia, as ordinarily
done, or to the action of gaseous ammonia mingled
with steam. Brown papers are strengthened and glazed
by passing them through a bath of pulp containing cupro-ammonium,
either with or without pitch, tar, or other
resinous matters. It is well known that by passing paper
through a cupro-ammonium bath it is surface dissolved
and glazed by its own material, and if it be desired to
unite two or more sheets together this is the most economical
way of conducting the operation; but if it be
desired to strengthen and glaze a single thickness of paper
or millboard, it is considered undesirable to make the
glaze by dissolving a portion of the paper itself. In this
case the inventors pass the web or sheet of paper through
a bath, not of cupro-ammonium simply, but of cupro-ammonium
in which ligneous material is already dissolved;
and when the glazing of brown paper is to be effected,
they prefer to fortify the bath with tar, pitch, marine
glue, or other resinous materials. By this process, panels
and tiles may be manufactured from millboard, or thick
sheets of ligneous material made from pulp already incorporated
with hydrated oxide of copper. The panels, etc.,
are passed, by means of an endless web, through a bath of
ammoniacal solution, or the vapour of ammonia and steam,
and the tiles or panels may be surface-glazed by exposing
them while moist to the action of fluo-silicic acid gas, by
which silica is deposited in the material and on its surface.</p>


<p><b>Dr. Wright's Process for preparing Cupro-ammonium.</b>&mdash;This
process, which has been adopted at the Willesden
Paper Mills, may be thus briefly described:&mdash;In the first
part of the process, metallic copper, in small lumps, solid
metal, or clippings, etc., is covered with a solution of ammonia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
in water, or with a weak solution of cupro-ammonium
hydrate, containing an amount of free ammonia in
solution dependent upon the strength of the copper solution
ultimately required; a current of air is then caused to
pass through the whole by means of an air-pump, in such
a manner that the bubbles of air pass over and amongst
the fragments of metallic copper, which, if in small particles,
may be advantageously kept in suspension by any
convenient agitator. In a few hours the liquid becomes
saturated with as much copper as it can dissolve, the rate
of solution varying with the form of the vessel containing
the materials, the strength of the ammoniacal fluid, and
the rate of the passage of the stream of air. To carry
this process into effect, metallic copper in fragments of
convenient size is loosely piled inside a vertical tube or
tower, and water is allowed to trickle from a pipe over the
copper so as to keep its surface moist. At the base of the
tower a current of air, mixed with ammonia gas, is caused
to pass into the tower, so as to ascend upwards, meeting
the descending water as it trickles over the copper. Under
these conditions the copper becomes oxidised, and the
water dissolves firstly the ammonia gas, and, secondly, the
oxide of copper formed, so that the liquor which passes out
at the base of the tower is a solution of cupro-ammonium
hydrate, the strength of which depends on the proportions
subsisting between the bulk of the mass of copper, the
quantity of water trickling over it, and the amount of
air and ammonia gas supplied in a given time. As an
example of the method of carrying out the above process,
the inventor proceeds as follows:&mdash;He constructs a vertical
iron tower which may be ten inches in internal diameter
and ten feet in height, and this is filled with scraps of
sheet copper. On this water is allowed to trickle, whilst
at the base of the tower a mixture of air and gaseous ammonia
is allowed to pass upwards through the tower, by
which a solution of cupro-ammonium is formed, which is
allowed to trickle out at the base of the tower into a tank.
It has been found advantageous to use a series of towers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
allowing the air and ammonia gas that pass out at the
top of the first tower to enter at the bottom of the second
tower, and so on successively throughout the series. The
weaker solutions produced in the later towers of the series
are used instead of water in the earlier towers, so that
practically all the ammonia gas originally used is obtained
in the form of cupro-ammonium hydrate solution, issuing
from the first tower of the series.</p>

<p>The cupro-ammonium process, as carried on at the Willesden
Mills, is applied to ropes, netting, etc., by immersing
them in a solution of cupro-ammonium, which, when
they are subsequently dried, gives them a varnished appearance,
while at the same time, the fibres having become
cemented together by the action of the cupro-ammonium,
their strength is increased. By the same process paper,
canvas, and other manufactured articles are rendered
waterproof. A concentrated solution of cupro-ammonium
may also be used for securing envelopes, whereby the
adhesion of the surfaces of the paper is rendered perfect,
and the only means of opening the envelope is by cutting
or tearing the paper.</p>


<p><b>Jouglet's Process.</b>&mdash;This process, which with modifications
has been adopted by others, is based on the solvent
action on cellulose of a solution of oxide of copper in ammonia.
A quantity of this solution is placed in a tank,
and the paper rapidly passed over and in contact with
the surface of the liquid, by means of suitable rollers in
motion. The paper is afterwards pressed between a pair of
rolls and dried by the ordinary drying cylinders. The
brief contact of the paper with the liquid occasions just
sufficient action on the cellulose to have the effect of an
impermeable varnish.</p>


<p><b>Waterproof Composition for Paper.</b>&mdash;The following
composition for rendering paper waterproof for roofing
and flooring purposes has been patented in America.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> By
preference good, hard manilla paper is selected, and a
composition of the following ingredients is applied with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
brush, or by means of rollers:&mdash;Glue, 2 lbs., is dissolved
in 3 gallons of crude petroleum, of about the density of
33° B. at 60° F.; 35 gallons of resin oil, and about half
a pint of oil of eucalyptus, which will have the effect of
destroying the objectionable odour of the resin oil. To
this mixture is further added about 4 gallons of any ordinary
drier. The above ingredients are to be thoroughly
mixed by agitation, and the composition brushed over
the paper in a room heated to about 80° F., and allowed
to dry. It is said that paper thus coated will exclude
wind, cold, dampness, and dust.</p>


<p><b>Toughening Paper.</b>&mdash;<em>Morfit's Process.</em>&mdash;The object of
the following process is to produce a paper "toughened in
a degree and quality distinctively from any other in the
market," and is applicable to all kinds of paper, but more
particularly to those made with inferior grades of pulp for
printing newspapers, and for wrapping papers. The means
employed are the seaweeds which form glutinous liquors
with water, such as Carrageen, or Irish moss, Agar-agar,
and the like. Any of such seaweeds may be employed,
either separately or mixed with another of its kind, according
to the judgment of the operator and the sort of paper
to be manufactured, but some seaweeds are superior to
others for this purpose. The raw seaweed is first washed,
and then boiled with water until all the soluble matter has
been extracted, and the resulting liquor is then strained.
The hot strained liquor forms the bath in which sheets of
paper or pulp are to be treated. If desired, resin soap and
aluminous cake may be added to the glutinous liquor, but
these "serve rather to size and make the paper rustle than
increase its toughness." If the paper is to be treated in
the form of sheets or web, it is to be passed, as it leaves
the wire-cloth in which it is formed, through a hot solution
of the seaweed alone, or mixed with resinous soap
and aluminous cake, and dried by means of suitable machinery.
To apply it to the pulp, the latter is to be diffused
in the hot liquor, and the sheets or web made therefrom in
the usual manner. The proper proportions of seaweed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
resinous soap, and aluminous cake will vary with the kind
of pulp and sheets under treatment, and must be adjusted
as the judgment of the operator determines best for each
operation.</p>


<p><b>Transparent Paper.</b>&mdash;There are several methods of
rendering paper transparent, amongst which the following
has been recommended:&mdash;</p>

<div class="p1 center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Boiled and bleached linseed oil</td><td class="tdr wd5">120</td><td class="tdc wd5">parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Lead turnings</td><td class="tdr">6</td><td class="tdc">"</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Oxide of zinc</td><td class="tdr">30</td><td class="tdc">"</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Venice turpentine</td><td class="tdr">3</td><td class="tdc">"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noindent">The above ingredients are placed in an iron or other suitable
vessel, in which they are thoroughly mixed, and the
whole then boiled for about eight hours. The mixture is
then allowed to cool, when it is again well stirred and the
following substances added:&mdash;White copal, 30 parts; gum
sandarac, 2 parts, these ingredients being well incorporated
by stirring.</p>


<p><b>Tracing Paper.</b>&mdash;Sheets of smooth unsized paper are
laid flat on a table, and then carefully coated on one side
only with a varnish composed of Canada balsam and oil of
turpentine. The brush used for this purpose must be a
clean sash tool, and when the first sheet has been varnished
in this way it is to be hung across a line to dry.
The operation is then to be applied to fresh sheets in succession
until the required quantity of paper has been
treated. In the event of one coating of the varnish not
rendering the paper sufficiently transparent, a second coating
may be applied when the first coating has become
quite dry.</p>


<p><b>Varnished Paper.</b>&mdash;When it is desired to varnish the
surface of paper, card-work, pasteboard, etc., it must first
be rendered non-absorbent with two or three coatings of
size, which will also prevent the varnish from acting upon
any colour or design which may be impressed upon the
paper. The size may be made by dissolving isinglass in
boiling water, or by boiling clean parchment cuttings in
water until a clear solution is formed, which, after straining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
is ready for use. If necessary, for very delicate purposes,
the size thus prepared may be clarified with a little
white of egg. The size should be applied, as in the former
case, with a clean sash tool, but the touch should be light,
especially for the first coating, lest the inks or colours
should run or become bleared. When dry, the varnish
may be applied in the usual way.</p>


<p><b>Oiled Paper.</b>&mdash;Sheets of paper are brushed over with
boiled linseed oil, and then hung up to dry. Paper thus
prepared is waterproof, and has been used as a substitute
for bladder and gut skins for covering jam pots, etc., but
the introduction of parchment paper has almost entirely
superseded it.</p>


<p><b>Lithographic Paper.</b>&mdash;This paper, which is written
upon with lithographic ink, may be prepared by either
of the following formulæ:&mdash;1. Take starch, 6 ozs.; gum
arabic, 2 ozs.; alum, 1 oz. Make a strong solution of each
separately in hot water, then mix the whole and strain the
liquor through gauze. It must be applied to one side of
the paper while still warm by means of a soft brush or
sponge; a second or third coating may be given as the
preceding one becomes dry. The paper is finally pressed
to render it smooth. 2. The paper must first receive three
coats of thin size, one coat of good white starch, and
one coat of a weak solution of gamboge in water. The
ingredients are to be applied cold with a sponge, and each
coat allowed to dry before the next is applied.</p>


<p><b>Cork Paper.</b>&mdash;A paper under this title was patented in
America by Messrs. H. Felt and Co.; it is prepared by coating
one side of a thick, soft, and flexible paper with a mixture
composed of glue, 20; gelatine, 1; and molasses, 3
parts, and covering with finely-powdered cork, which is
afterwards lightly rolled in. The paper thus prepared is
said to be used for packing bottles.</p>


<p><b>New Japanese Paper.</b>&mdash;According to the <cite>Bulletin du
Musée Commercial</cite>, a native of Japan has recently invented
a new process by which paper may be made from seaweed.
The paper thus made is said to be very strong, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
untearable, and is sufficiently transparent to admit of its
being used as a substitute for window glass; it takes all
colours well, and in many respects resembles old window
glass.&mdash;<cite>Board of Trade Journal.</cite></p>


<p><b>Blotting Paper.</b>&mdash;This paper, requiring to be very absorbent,
is not sized, but is prepared with starch alone,
which, while holding the fibres together, does not affect
the absorbent property of the paper. Dunbar gives a
recipe for making blotting paper which has been found
successful, and from which we make a few extracts. In
selecting materials for blotting, of high-class, cotton rags
of the weakest and tenderest description procurable should
be chosen. Boil them with 4 lbs. of caustic soda to the
cwt.&mdash;that is, if you have no facilities for boiling them in
lime alone. When furnished to the breaking-engine, wash
the rags thoroughly before letting down the roll; when
this is done, reduce them to half-stuff, and as soon as
possible convey them to the potcher. When up to the
desired colour, drain immediately. The breaker-plate
should be sharp for blottings, and the beater-roll and plate
also in good order, and the stuff beaten smartly for not
more than an hour and a half in the engine. For pink
blottings furnish two-thirds white cottons and one-third
of Turkey reds if they can be got, or dye with cochineal to
desired shade; empty down to the machine before starting,
and see that the vacuum pumps are in good condition.
Remove weights from couch-roll, and if there are lifting
screws raise the top couch-roll a little. Take shake-belt
off, as the shake will not be required. Press light with
first press, and have the top roll of the second press covered
with an ordinary jacket similar to couch-roll jacket. Dry
hard, and pass through one calender with weights off, and
roll as light as possible, just enough to smooth slightly.</p>


<p><b>Parchment Paper.</b>&mdash;This paper, which is extensively
used for covering jars and pots for pickles and jams, is
prepared, according to the process of Poumarède and
Figuier, as follows:&mdash;White unsized paper is dipped for
half a minute in strong sulphuric acid, specific gravity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
1·842, and afterwards in water containing a little ammonia.
By Gaine's process (1857) unsized paper is
plunged for a few seconds into sulphuric acid diluted with
half to a quarter of its bulk of water (the acid being added
to the water), and the solution allowed to cool until of the
same temperature as the air. The paper is afterwards
washed with weak ammonia. This process, which has
been extensively worked by Messrs. De la Rue and Co.,
produces a far better material than the foregoing.</p>


<p><b>Mill and Card-board.</b>&mdash;In the manufacture of boards
refuse materials of all kinds that occur in the paper-mill
may be used, and these are sorted according to the quality
of boards for which they are best suited. After being well
beaten the resulting mass is mixed with suitable proportions
of rag pulp, kaolin, chalk, white clays, &amp;c. There
are four principal processes by which boards are manufactured,
namely,</p>

<p>1. By superposing several sheets of paper and causing
them to unite by a sizing material.</p>

<p>2. By superposing several wet leaves at the time of
couching.</p>

<p>3. By moulds provided with thick deckles.</p>

<p>4. By special machines similar to those used for making
continuous webs of paper, but without a drying cylinder,
the sheets being dried in the open air or in a heated room.</p>

<p>The third method is only adopted for boards of moderate
thickness, as an excess of pulp would render the draining
difficult.</p>


<p><b>Making Paper or Cardboard with two Faces by Ordinary
Machine.</b>&mdash;By this process, recently patented by
Mr. A. Diana, all kinds of thin or thick paper or cardboard
are manufactured with two different faces by means of the
ordinary paper-machine, having a single flat table with a
single wire-gauze web, without requiring a second metallic
web. For this purpose the two pulps are prepared
separately, and one is caused to pass on to the web in an
almost liquid condition; this is allowed to drain off sufficiently,
and the second pulp (also in a liquid condition) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
then passed uniformly upon the whole surface of the previous
layer. The water drains off from this layer through
the first layer, and the paper or cardboard is thus directly
formed with two different faces, the subsequent operations
being as ordinarily employed in paper-making. The space
between two of the suction cases employed for drawing off
the water in the pulp is a suitable point for the distribution
of the diluted second pulp, which is almost liquid.</p>


<p><b>Test Papers.</b>&mdash;These papers, which are extensively used
both in the laboratory and the factory, for determining the
presence of acids or alkalies in various liquids, may be prepared
as follows:&mdash;<em>Litmus paper</em>, for detecting the presence
of acids, is prepared by first making an infusion of
litmus. Reduce to a paste with a pestle and mortar 1 oz.
of litmus, adding a little boiling water; then add more
boiling water&mdash;from 3 to 4 ozs. in all&mdash;and put the mixture
into a flask and boil for a few minutes; finally, add
more boiling water to make up half a pint, and when cold
filter the liquor. To prepare the test paper, a sufficient
quantity of the liquid being poured into a flat dish, pieces
of unsized paper are steeped in the blue liquid, so that all
surfaces may be thoroughly wetted; the paper is then to
be hung up by one corner to drain, and afterwards dried.
As many sheets of paper as may be required should be
treated in this way, and the sheets afterwards cut up into
convenient strips for use. <em>Red litmus paper</em>, for detecting
slight traces of alkali in liquids, may be prepared by
dipping a glass rod, previously dipped into a very dilute
solution of sulphuric acid, into one-half of the above infusion,
repeating the operation cautiously until the liquid
turns from blue to a slightly red tint. Unsized paper
when dipped in this will acquire a reddish colour which is
very sensitive to the action of weak alkaline liquors, and
the vapour of ammonia restores the blue colour instantly.
<em>Turmeric paper</em> is prepared by dipping unsized paper in a
decoction of turmeric&mdash;about 2 ozs. to the pint. Paper
steeped in this solution and dried acquires a yellow colour,
which turns brown in alkaline solutions.</p>

<p class="noindent">Apart from the mechanical contrivances which are referred
to in various parts of this work, in which their
application is explained, it will be necessary to direct
attention to certain machines and appliances which are
adopted at some of the more advanced paper-mills in this
country and in America; but since the various makers of
paper-makers' machinery are constantly introducing improvements
to meet the requirements of the manufacturer,
we must refer the reader to these firms for fuller information
than can be given in the limited scope of this treatise.
Many of the improvements in paper-making machinery
consist in modifications&mdash;sometimes of a very important
nature&mdash;in the construction of certain parts of a machine,
whereby the efficiency of the machine as a whole is in
some cases considerably augmented. Without offering
any critical remarks upon the merits of the respective
improvements which have been introduced, it will be
sufficient to direct attention to the manufacturer's own
description of the principal features of the special mechanical
contrivance which he produces for the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
paper-maker. It may also be said that innumerable
patents have been obtained for various improvements in
machinery, or parts of machines, engines, etc., which
can readily be referred to at the Library of the Patent
Office, or any of the public libraries throughout the Kingdom.</p>

<p><b>Bentley and Jackson's Drum-Washer.</b>&mdash;This drum-washer,
for use in the rag-engine, is shown in Fig. 43.
It has cast-iron ends, strong copper buckets, shaft, stands,
lifting-gear, and driving-wheel, but instead of the drum
being covered with the ordinary strong brass backing-wire,
it is covered with their improved "honey-comb" <em>backing-plates</em>,
over which the fine wire is wrapped as usual. The
honey-comb backing consists of tough rolled brass or
copper plates, curved to suit the diameter of the drum,
and secured to its ends by cross-bars. It is practicably
indestructible, strengthens the drum, and by maintaining
its cylindrical form, adds considerably to the durability of
the fine covering-wire.</p>

of hard cast-iron, turned and polished on outside surface.
The ends and trunnions are of tough cast iron, turned to
fit into their places, and there secured by bolts and nuts
by a patented method, whereby no bolts (excepting for
the manhole) are put through the metal, an unbroken
surface is preserved, and the annoyance of leakage through
the bolt-holes is avoided. A manhole and cover is fitted
to all cylinders 3 feet in diameter and upwards, and a
water-lifter and pipe to remove the condensed steam.
The trunnions are bored to receive nozzles or junctions
for admitting steam, and the whole, when completed,
is carefully balanced and tested by steam pressure to
35 lbs. per square inch. The firm state that they have
made cylinders from 2 to 10 feet in diameter by this

<p><b>Paper-cutting Machine.</b>&mdash;This machine (Fig. 46),
which is manufactured by the same firm, is constructed to
cut from one to eight webs simultaneously, in sheets of
any required length, from 8 to 60 inches. It is built on
the "Verny" principle, and its operation is as follows:&mdash;The
webs of paper from the reel-rolls are carried by an
endless felt, and the paper is drawn off the rolls by
travelling cast-iron gripper beams, which firmly grasp the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
felt and the webs of paper to be cut, the travel of the
beams being equal to the length of the sheet of paper to
be cut. When the required length of the sheet is drawn
from the rolls, a cast-iron clamp, placed close to the dead
cross-cut knife, descends and firmly holds the paper until
the movable cross-cut knife has cut off the sheets, which
fall on a second endless felt, and are placed by the catchers
in the usual manner. As soon as the sheets are cut, the
clamp is released, and the travelling-grippers are again
ready to seize the paper and repeat the operation.</p>

<p><b>Cooling and Damping Rolls.</b>&mdash;The illustration (Fig. 48)
represents an apparatus, constructed by Messrs. Bentley
and Jackson, for cooling and damping paper after leaving
the drying cylinders and before passing through the
calenders. It consists of two brass rolls bored and fitted
with cast-iron ends, brass nozzles, and regulating taps,
through which the rolls are supplied with a constant flow
of water. The rolls are carried by cast-iron standards,
fitted with brass steps and cast-iron caps. Jets of steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
are blown on each of the rolls from a perforated copper
pipe running parallel with, and at a little distance from,
the body of the roll. The steam is condensed on the cold
surfaces of the brass rolls, and absorbed by the web of
paper, which passes around and in contact with their surfaces,
and is consequently damped on <em>both</em> sides. The
perforated steam-pipes are enclosed by copper hoods, to
prevent the steam from spreading, and the supply of
steam is regulated by ordinary brass valves or cocks. The
rolls are geared together by a pair of spur-wheels, and
driven by a pulley of suitable diameter.</p>

rag-engine for sharpening rag-engine roll-bars, and it
will be seen that by means of it the operation can be performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
without removing the roll from its usual position.
The edges of the bars are first
planed by a tool supplied by
the manufacturers to render
the whole cylindrical before
sharpening them; the bevelled
sides are then planed by suitable
tools, two of which accompany
the apparatus. This
method of sharpening renders
the bars uniform in shape, the
roll is kept in better working
order, and it can be dressed
in considerably less time, and
at less expense, than can be
done by chipping by hand.</p>

<p><b>Washing-Cylinder for Rag-Engine.</b>&mdash;The illustration at
Fig. 53 represents the machine as manufactured by

that the water is delivered
on the driving side of the
rag-engine, thus avoiding
any trough across the engine,
and admitting of the
midfeather being thin, as
is usual in cast-iron engines.
It is all self-contained,
and the driving
apparatus is wholly on the

The raising and lowering
are effected by a worm
and worm-wheel, so that
the cylinder will stop at
any point required.</p>

and re-reeling webs of
paper, especially where
large webs are requisite
for web-calendering,
web-printing, and
suchlike. The reel of
paper from the paper-machine
is placed on
a sliding-carriage arrangement,
the brackets
of which are planed
and fitted to a planed
sole, with wedge or
dove-tail corners, and
controlled by screws,

that the reel can
quickly and easily be
moved forward or backward
to suit any unequal
reeling that may
have taken place on
the paper or the machine.
A hot cast-iron

applied. The machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
has an important application
of drawing-in or regulating rolls
of cast iron, with arrangement of
expanding pulley for regulating
the tension on the paper. Slitting-knives,
regulating, dancing,
or leading-rolls, of cast iron, etc.,
are applied for separating the edges
and guiding the webs after they
are slit. The reeling is performed
by a 3-feet diameter drum, cross-shafts,
and arms, to which regulating
heads are fitted, so that several
webs can be run up at one operation.</p>

<p><b>Roeckner's Clarifier.</b>&mdash;In this apparatus, of which an
illustration is given in Fig. 61, Mr. Roeckner has taken
advantage of the fact that if a column of liquid is ascending
very slowly and quietly within a vessel, it will not be
able to carry up with it the solid particles which it contains,
which will gradually fall back and sink to the
bottom under the action of gravity, without ever reaching
the top of the vessel, provided this be of sufficient height.
The illustration shows the arrangement of the apparatus
on a small scale; the liquor to be clarified is run into a well
or reservoir <em>b</em>; into this dip a wrought-iron cylinder <em>c</em>,
which is open at the lower end, but hermetically closed at
the top by means of the casing <em>d</em>. From this casing air can
be withdrawn through a pipe, <em>h</em>, by means of an air-pump <em>i</em>.
As soon as this is done the liquid will begin to ascend the
cylinder <em>c</em>, and if the height of this is below that to which
the water will rise at the atmospheric pressure (say 25 feet),
the liquid will ascend until it fills the cylinder and the
casing. Into the pocket at the side of the casing there
dips a pipe <em>g</em>, which passes out through the opposite side
of the casing, descends below the level of the water in the
tank, and ends in a discharge-cock. When this cock is
opened, the cylinder <em>c</em> and the pipe <em>g</em> form between them
a syphon, of which, however, the descending leg is of very
small diameter compared with the ascending leg. In consequence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the liquid will rise in the cylinder <em>c</em> very slowly.
The sediment it contains will sink back and collect in the
bottom of the tank <em>b</em>, and clear water will flow out at the
outlet. A sludge-cock at the bottom of the tank allows
the solid matter to be drawn off at intervals and conveyed
to any convenient place for drying, etc.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> For drawing
clear water from a river, the clarifier would simply be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
placed in the river, dipping 2 or 3 inches into it below
the lowest water-level. The clear water will then be drawn
through the clarifier, while the heavier matters will fall
down and be carried away by the river current. It is
stated that this has proved a great advantage to a paper-mill
which used a river, and had, prior to its use, been
much troubled through the dirt being pumped with the
water. The clarifier to receive the waste from paper-machinery,
or from washings in the engines, can be placed
in any convenient corner, and by its action the water can
be re-used, and the otherwise lost fibres collected, without
its action ever being stopped.</p>

<p><b>Marshall's Perfecting Engine.</b>&mdash;This engine, a longitudinal
section of which is shown in Fig. 62, has been
introduced into this country by Messrs. Bentley and Jackson,
and is described in <em>Industries</em><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> as follows:&mdash;"The machine,
which is the invention of Mr. F. Marshall, of Turner's
Falls, Mass., U.S.A., is used in one of the processes of paper
manufacture, and has for its purpose the more effectual drawing
of the pulp fibre, the clearance of knots from the pulp
previous to its delivery on to the paper-making machine,
and the saving of time in the treatment of the material. As
will be seen in the illustration (Fig. 62), the machine consists
essentially of a cast-iron conical casing, bored, and
fitted with about two hundred elbowed steel knives, <span class="fs70">G</span>,
placed in sections. At the large end of this conical casing
is placed a movable disc, also fitted with about two hundred
and ten steel knives, <span class="fs70">F</span>, and capable of adjustment by
means of a screw, worm, worm-wheel, and hand-wheel, <span class="fs70">E</span>.
The revolving cone and disc are of cast iron, fitted with
straight steel knives firmly keyed upon a hammered iron
shaft, and carefully balanced to prevent vibration. The
knives of the revolving cone and disc are brought into
contact with the stationary knives by means of the hand-wheel,
<span class="fs70">E</span>, and the disc-knives can be independently adjusted
by means of the hand-wheel <span class="fs70">C</span>, which actuates a
screw on the conical casing by means of the worm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
worm-wheel shown. The machine is driven by means of
a pulley <span class="fs70">A</span>, and the
whole machine is
mounted on a cast-iron
base-plate. The
pulp material enters
the engine in the
direction indicated
by the arrow, <span class="fs70">B</span>, at
the small end of the
cone, and is by the
rotary and centrifugal
action of the
revolving cone, propelled
to its large
end, and during its
passage is reduced
to a fine pulp by
the action of the
knives. It then
passes through the
knives, <span class="fs70">F</span>, of the
stationary and rotating
discs, by
which the fibres are
further crushed or
split up, all knots
or strings rubbed
out, and the pulp
effectually cleared
previous to its exit
through the passage
<span class="fs70">D</span>." We are informed
that the machine
is capable of treating
from 900 lbs. to
1,200 lbs. of pulp per
hour. The power required to drive it is estimated at from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
40 i.h.p. to 50 i.h.p. when making 300 revolutions per
minute. This, however, is dependent on the amount of
friction caused between the surfaces of the fixed and
revolving knives. The flow space occupied is 12ft. 6in.
in length, and 4ft. in width. The perfecting machine, in
its complete form, is shown in Fig. 63.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Recovery of Soda.</b>&mdash;Probably one of the most important
improvements in modern paper-making, at least from an
economical point of view, is the process of recovering one
of the most costly, and at the same time most extensively
used, materials employed in the manufacture&mdash;soda. While
not a great many years since (and in some mills is still the
case even now), it was customary to allow the spent soda
liquors resulting from the boiling of various fibres to run
into the nearest rivers, thus not only wasting a valuable
product, but also polluting the streams into which they
were allowed to flow, means are now adopted by which
a considerable proportion of the soda is recovered and
rendered available for further use. The means by
which this is effected are various, but all have for their
object the expulsion of the water and the destruction of
the organic matters dissolved out of the fibrous substances
in the process of boiling with caustic soda solutions. One
of the main objects of the various methods of recovering
the soda from spent liquors is to utilise, as far as practicable,
all the heat that is generated from the fuel used,
whereby the process of evaporation may be effected in the
most economical way possible. The principle upon which
the most successful methods are based is that the flame
and heat pass over and under a series of evaporating pans,
and through side flues, by which time the heat has become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
thoroughly utilised and exhausted. When all the water
has been expelled, the resulting dry mass is ignited and
allowed to burn out, when the black ash that remains,
which is carbonate of soda, is afterwards dissolved out,
and the alkaline liquor causticised with lime in the usual
manner. According to Dunbar, 8 cwt. of recovered ash
and 4½ cwt. of good lime will produce 900 gallons of
caustic ley at 11° Tw. The liquor is then pumped into
settling tanks, from which it is delivered to the boilers
when required.</p>

by means of a pipe <span class="fs70">C</span>, provided with a tap. At one end of
the chamber is a furnace <span class="fs70">D</span>, the flame of which passes
through the chamber and over the surface of the liquor
lying upon the floor, heating the chamber, evaporating,
and at last incinerating, its contents, and at the same time
warming the liquor in the tank above, and evaporating
some of its water. The products of the combustion in the
furnace, and of evaporation, pass by the flue into a chimney,
and escape thence into the air. There is a door <span class="fs70">E</span> in
the side of the furnace near the level of the floor of the
chamber, and this is opened from time to time to enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the workmen to stir and move about the contents of the
chamber, and finally, when the process is sufficiently
advanced, to draw out the residue. The first effect produced
is the reduction of the liquor to the consistence of
tar. Later on, a white crust, which is the incinerated
material, forms on the surface, and is drawn on one side
by the workmen, so as to allow of fresh crust being formed.
When all the charge has become solid it is drawn. The
charge is usually withdrawn before the conversion into
carbonate is completed; it is then raked out into barrows
and placed in a heap, generally in a shed or chamber, open
on one side, but sometimes in a closed brick-chamber or
den, where the combustion continues for several weeks.
The result is the fusion of the material into a grey rocky
substance, which consists chiefly of carbonate and silicate
of soda.</p>

<p>Various modifications of the esparto evaporator and calciner
have, however, been introduced since the recovery of
soda has become more general, and are in use at various
works, all having for their main object the economising of
fuel and the utilising of the waste heat of the fire, which
in the old-fashioned calciner goes up the chimney and is
lost. The leading principle, of all of them is to use the
waste heat in concentrating the liquor preparatory to its
being run into the part where the calcination is to be
effected. This is done by so extending and widening out
the flue as to cause the heated air and flame, after they
have performed their function in the calcination, to pass
over or under their layers of liquor, lying upon shelves or
floors in such a way that the liquor shall become more and
more concentrated as it approaches the calciner by successive
steps or gradations.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>&mdash;<cite>Dr. Ballard.</cite></p>

<p><b>Roeckner's Evaporator.</b>&mdash;This apparatus, an illustration
of which is shown in Fig. 65, is thus described by Dr.
Ballard, medical officer of the Local Government Board,
who was specially appointed by the board to investigate
the effluvium nuisances which arise in connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
certain manufacturing industries. "In this apparatus
there is above the calcining floor a series of shelves or
shallow pans, alternating in such a manner that the liquor
flowing from the tank above into the uppermost of them,
flows, after a partial evaporation, over the edge of the
shelf into the shelf or shallow pan next below, and in this
way from shelf to shelf, still becoming more and more
concentrated until it reaches the final floor, over which the
flame from the actual fire plays, and where the first part
of the calcination is effected. The heated air, in passing
to the chimney, passes over each of these shelves in succession,
heating them and concentrating the liquor upon
them. There is between the lower shelves an arrangement
for causing the liquor to pass from the upper to the
lower by means of a pipe, instead of its running over the
edge. At the top of all is a covered tank, where the temperature
of the liquor is raised before it is run into the
evaporator. In order to promote the heating of the liquor
in this tank, the lower part of the tank is made to communicate
by side pipes with tubes passing across the
evaporator near the fire, as, for instance, at the bridge and
at the further end of the calcining floor. In this way a
circulation of liquor is set up which serves to heat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
liquor in the tank more effectually. A pipe from the top
of the tank leads to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the chimey-shaft'">the chimney-shaft</ins>, conducting any
vapours into it. As the incinerated crust forms it is raked
on one side, and when sufficient of it has accumulated it
is drawn to an opening (provided with a damper) at the
side or end of the floor, and discharged down this opening
into a brick chamber below, which is inclosed by iron
doors, and from which a flue conducts the vapours that
arise during the final fusion through the fire in such a way
as to consume them." By recent improvements Mr.
Roeckner has constructed an apparatus for condensing and
rendering inoffensive the vapours eliminated from the
liquor during its evaporation on the successive shelves of
his evaporator.</p>


<p><b>Porion's Evaporator.</b>&mdash;This evaporator and incinerating
furnace much resembles in principle an ordinary reverberatory
furnace, except that it is provided with paddle
agitators, which project the liquid upwards, causing it to
descend in a spray, thus increasing the surface of the
liquid coming in contact with the hot air and current of
smoke traversing the furnace. By this method the expense
of fuel is greatly reduced. The residue is in a state of
ignition when it is withdrawn from the furnace, and is
piled in heaps so that it may burn slowly. When the
combustion is complete, the resulting calcined mass is
treated with water, and the carbonate of soda formed is
afterwards causticised in the usual way. About two-thirds
of the soda is thus recovered.</p>


<p><b>The Yaryan Evaporator.</b>&mdash;Mr. Homer T. Yaryan, of
Toledo, Ohio, U.S.A., has introduced some important
improvements in evaporating apparatus, which have been
fully recognised in America, and appear to have been
attended with success. The principle involved is that of
multiple effects, in which the evaporation takes place
while the liquid is flowing through heated coils of pipe or
conduits, and in which the vapour is separated from the
liquid in a chamber, at the discharge end of the coils, and
is conducted to the heating <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'cylinders urrounding'">cylinder surrounding</ins> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
evaporating coils of the next effect, from the first to the
last effect. The objects of the invention are: (1) to provide
extended vaporising coils or conduits and increased heating
surface for each liquid feed supply in the heating
cylinders, and provide improved means for feeding the
liquid, whereby each set or coil of vaporising tubes will
receive a positive and uniform supply of liquid without
danger of the feed ducts being clogged by extraneous
matter; (2) to positively control the amount of liquid fed
by the pump to the evaporating coils, and make it more
uniform than heretofore, regardless of the speed of the
pump; (3) to provide improved separating chambers at
the discharge ends of the vaporising coils so as to better
free liquid and solid particles from the vapours; (4) to
provide for the successful treatment of the most frothy
liquids by causing the vapours carrying solid and liquid
particles to pass through catch-all chambers, where they
are arrested and precipitated and then returned to the
evaporating coils; (5) to secure a more positive flow and
circulation of liquid from the evaporating cylinder of one
effect to another, under the influence of a better vacuum
than heretofore in multiple-effect vacuum evaporating
apparatus; (6) to provide for transferring a better concentrated
liquid into the separating chamber containing
cooler concentrated liquid in direct connection with the
condenser and vacuum pump, so as to equalise the temperature
of the two liquids, and then draw off both by one
tail pump.</p>

<p>The present invention comprises a series of important
improvements on an apparatus described by Mr. Yaryan
in a former English patent, No. 14,162 (1886), and covers
a number of important modifications in construction,
whereby improved results are secured. It is only necessary,
therefore, to give the details of the new patent, No.
213 (1888), since it embodies the latest improvements
which practical working of the apparatus has suggested.

<p>The evaporating cylinders are mounted upon a framework
<span class="fs70">Y</span>, supported upon columns <span class="fs70">X X</span>, or other suitable
supports. The apparatus is shown arranged as quadruple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
effect, with four connected cylinders, but multiple effect
apparatus may be constructed with an increased number
of cylinders up to ten or twelve. The heating cylinders
<span class="fs70">B<sup>1</sup> B<sup>2</sup> B<sup>3</sup> B<sup>4</sup></span>, containing the evaporating tubes or coils, are
preferably arranged in the same horizontal plane, and are
provided at the discharge ends of the evaporating coils
with separating chambers, <span class="fs70">A<sup>1</sup> A<sup>2</sup> A<sup>3</sup> A<sup>4</sup></span>, of enlarged diameter,
and at the supply ends of the coils with the coils with
return bend ends, <span class="fs70">C<sup>1</sup> C<sup>2</sup> C<sup>3</sup> C<sup>4</sup></span>. From each separating chamber,
<span class="fs70">A<sup>1</sup>, A<sup>2</sup></span>, valve pipe <span class="fs70">D<sup>1</sup> D<sup>2</sup> D<sup>3</sup></span> leads into the shell of the
next heating cylinder, as <span class="fs70">B<sup>2</sup>, B<sup>3</sup>, B<sup>4</sup></span>, and vapour pipe <span class="fs70">D<sup>4</sup></span>
leads from the last separator <span class="fs70">A<sup>4</sup></span> to the condenser <span class="fs70">H</span>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>the vacuum pump <span class="fs70">H<sup>1</sup></span>. A cylindrical catch-all chamber
<span class="fs70">E<sup>1</sup>, E<sup>2</sup>, E<sup>3</sup>, E<sup>4</sup></span>, is connected in each vapour pipe between each
separator and each successive heating cylinder, as shown
in Figs. 66, 67, and 68, and in detail in Fig. 75. Gauge
glass and liquid receiving chambers, <span class="fs70">G<sup>1</sup>, G<sup>2</sup>, G<sup>3</sup>, G<sup>4</sup></span>, connect
with the bottom of each separating chamber for receiving
the liquid as it is separated from the vapour, and a gauge
glass <em>g</em> is applied to each of such chambers. Liquid discharge
and transfer pipes <em>t</em>, <em>t<sup>1</sup></em>, having valves <em>h</em>, <em>h<sup>1</sup></em>, as best
shown in Figs. 66, 68, and 72, lead respectively from chambers
<span class="fs70">G<sup>1</sup></span>, <span class="fs70">G<sup>2</sup></span>, of the first and second effect to the manifold
feed pipes leading into the cylinders <span class="fs70">B<sup>3</sup></span>, <span class="fs70">B<sup>4</sup></span>, of the third
and fourth effect for the purpose hereafter described. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
main steam supply pipe <span class="fs70">F</span>, having a safety valve <em>f</em> and stop
valve <em>f<sup>1</sup></em>, Figs. 66, 67, and 68, connects with the heating
cylinder <span class="fs70">B<sup>1</sup></span> of the first effect. The evaporating tubes 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, are expanded or otherwise secured in the tube
sheets <em>d</em> and <em>e″</em> at opposite ends of the cylinders, and are
properly connected at the ends in sets of five to form
coils. The outer rear return-bend head <span class="fs70">C<sup>1</sup> C<sup>2</sup></span>, etc., are
provided on their insides with numerous short intersecting
partition plates <em>c</em>, forming single and double cells, properly
arranged for connecting the evaporating tubes in
sets of five, as shown in Figs. 75, 76, 77.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_215.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 81. Fig. 82.</div>

<p>The heads are pierced with holes <em>c′</em> for connecting the
liquid supply pipes <span class="fs70">M</span> of the manifolds <span class="fs70">L</span>. The inner
return-bend head <span class="fs70">T</span> in the separating chambers are formed
like heads <span class="fs70">C<sup>1</sup> C<sup>2</sup></span>, etc., with intersecting partition plates <em>x</em>,
and are provided with discharge openings <em>t″</em> for every fifth
tube, as shown in Fig. 69. Tube sheet <em>d</em> is made of considerably
larger diameter than cylinders <span class="fs70">B<sup>1</sup> B<sup>2</sup></span>, etc., and
acts as a vibrating diaphragm, to accommodate the expansion
and contraction of the tubes. The separating chambers
may be constructed with dash plates <em>b</em> <em>b</em>, two or more
in number, having openings <em>g′</em> <em>g′</em> alternately upon opposite
sides for the passage of vapour, and opening <em>a′</em> at the
bottom for the passage of liquid, as shown in Fig. 80.
Here a tube sheet <em>z</em> is provided near the openings of the
evaporating tubes, and in such sheet are set numerous
small horizontal tubes <em>n</em>, which discharge against a
vertical arresting plate <em>b′</em> set near their open ends. Water
and solid matter are impelled against the plate and
thereby arrested and caused to flow down to the bottom of
the chamber. The liquid feed apparatus consists of a
supply tank <span class="fs70">K</span>, stand-pipe <span class="fs70">J</span>, feed box <span class="fs70">K<sup>1</sup></span>, double
pump <span class="fs70">I</span>, manifold <span class="fs70">L</span>, and connecting pipes and valves.
The liquid to be evaporated flows from tank <span class="fs70">K</span>, through
pipe <em>k</em>, to stand-pipe <span class="fs70">J</span> and box <span class="fs70">K<sup>1</sup></span>, the flow being constant
and uniform, and of the desired quantity, by means of a
valve <em>k′</em> having a lever handle <em>r′</em> which is connected by a
cord or chain passing over a pulley <em>j</em> with float <em>q</em> in stand-pipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<span class="fs70">J</span>. The valve opening in pipe <em>k</em> being properly
adjusted by means of the float, etc., the liquid is admitted
to the stand-pipe <span class="fs70">J</span> while the column of liquid is automatically
maintained at any desired height and pressure
regardless of the quantity in the supply tank, by means of
the float <em>q</em>, which, as it rises, tends to close valve <em>k′</em>, and
as it falls, to open the valve. From the bottom of the
stand-pipe <span class="fs70">J</span>, nozzle <em>j′</em> discharges a constant and uniform
stream of liquid into feed box <span class="fs70">K<sup>1</sup></span>. The suction pipe <span class="smcap">I″</span> of
pump <span class="fs70">I</span> extends into box <span class="fs70">K<sup>1</sup></span>, where it terminates in a
turned-down nozzle provided with valve <em>i</em> having a lever
handle and float <em>z</em>. As a given amount of liquid is constantly
running into the box, should the pump run too
fast the float lowers, partially closing the valve and
lessening the amount of liquid drawn at each stroke of
the pump, and preventing air from being drawn in, since
the end of the suction pipe is always sealed by the liquid.
The liquid is forced by pump <span class="fs70">I</span> into the manifolds <span class="fs70">L</span>, from
which it flows through the contracted ducts <em>l</em> into the
enlarged feed pipes <em>m</em>, as shown in Figs. 73 and 74. Ducts
<em>l</em> are of about one-half inch diameter, and the upper and
lower sections thereof are connected by a union coupling,
one portion of which <em>l′</em> has a reducer with opening one-quarter
inch diameter, more or less, according to the
amount of liquid it is desired to feed.</p>

<p>The catch-all chambers <span class="fs70">E<sup>1</sup> E<sup>2</sup></span>, etc., Figs. 66, 78, and 79,
are provided each at its inlet end <em>e</em>, with tube sheet <em>o</em>
extending across its diameter a short distance in front of
the opening of vapour pipe <span class="fs70">D<sup>1</sup></span>, and in such sheet are fixed
numerous longitudinal tubes <em>p</em> extending to near the
opposite head <em>e′</em>, so that vapours carrying watery or solid
particles are impelled against the head and arrested.
Liquid and solid matter, arrested in the catch-all chambers,
flow through pipes <em>v</em> <em>v′</em> <em>v″</em> down into the fluid transfer pipe
<em>t t′</em> (Figs. 67, 68, and 72), and thence into the evaporating
coils and through pipe <em>v‴</em> directly to the tail pump <span class="fs70">W</span>,
Fig. 67. By use of the catch-all chambers the most frothy
liquids can he readily and economically managed. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
liquid transfer pipe <em>s</em>, having a valve <em>h″</em>, leads directly
from receiving chamber <span class="fs70">G<sup>3</sup></span> of the third effect to the
separating chamber <span class="fs70">A<sup>4</sup></span> of the fourth effect, the latent heat
being carried off in the vapours drawn by the vacuum
pump <span class="fs70">H<sup>1</sup></span> into the chamber <span class="fs70">H</span>, and the finished liquid of
both effects is drawn off through pipe <em>w</em> by one and the
same tail pipe pump <span class="fs70">W</span>. The water of condensation accumulating
in the heating cylinders <span class="fs70">B<sup>1</sup> B<sup>2</sup></span>, etc., is transferred
from one to the other through connecting pipes <em>u</em> <em>u′</em> <em>u″</em>
having valves <em>y</em>, shown in Figs. 66, 67, and 68; and finally
from cylinder <span class="fs70">B<sup>4</sup></span> through pipe <em>u‴</em> directly into condenser
<span class="fs70">H</span>. The specification of the patent, which those interested
will do well to consult, next describes the operation of the
apparatus.</p>


<p><b>American System of Soda Recovery.</b>&mdash;Mr. Congdon
gives an exhaustive description<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> of the method of recovering
soda in the United States, from whose interesting
paper we extract the following:&mdash;The spent liquors are
delivered to the Yaryan evaporator from the pans at a
density of 6° to 7° B. at 130° F. Here they are
concentrated to 34° to 42° at 140° F. At this density
they are fed into furnaces of a reverberatory type, where
they are burnt to a cherry-red heat; and the ash then
raked out. This ash, which averages 50 per cent. of soda,
is weighed in iron barrows on suitable scales, and wheeled
into the leaching-room for lixiviation. The system of
leaching, as it is termed in the States, is conducted as follows:&mdash;Iron
tanks are used, with suitable piping, that
allows pumping from one tank to another, and also to
pump from any one of them up to the causticising tanks
in the alkali-room. There is also a water-line by which
water may be pumped into any of the tanks, and there is
a spout used in washing away the black ash sludge. The
leaching-tanks have false bottoms of 2in. by 2in. stuff,
placed crosswise, over which is a layer of gravel, on which
lies a layer of straw, by which the liquor is filtered. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
gravel is removed every few days, and the straw with
every charge. When one of the tanks is filled with black
ash, it is "wet down" with the stored liquor (the strongest
of the stored weak liquors), and also with the strongest
weak liquors from the tanks, and with weak liquors
obtained from these tanks by pumping water upon them
and keeping them full. This is all pumped up to the
causticising-tank until the strength is reduced to 2° or
1½° B. The remaining liquor is then drained into a tank
known as the "clear-liquor" tank, owing to there being
no black ash in it. The liquor from the next weakest pan
is then pumped upon the pan containing the black ash,
and the next weakest liquor pumped upon this. The
weaker pans are then in succession pumped upon the
stronger, and the water pumped upon these, and thus a
very perfect washing is obtained. The sludge left behind
is nothing but charcoal, with a slight trace of carbonate
of soda. Mr. Congdon illustrates the above system thus.
The tanks stand as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>No. 1. Clear liquor, 1° to 2° B. (strongest).</p>

<p>No. 2. Black ash sludge (weaker than No. 3).</p>

<p>No. 3. Black ash, after sending up to causticising-tank
(strongest sludge).</p>

<p>No. 4. Fresh black ash.</p>

<p>No. 5. Weaker than No. 2 (sludge only).</p>

<p>No. 6. Weaker than No. 5 (sludge and weakest liquor).</p>

<p>The method of procedure is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Liquor from No. 3 drained into No. 1 (now full).</p>

<p>No. 6 pumped on to No. 2 (No. 6 sludge thrown away).</p>

<p>Liquor from No. 2 drained upon No. 3.</p>

<p>Water put on No. 5.</p>

<p>No. 5 pumped upon No. 2 (No. 5 sludge thrown away).</p>

<p>The black ash is treated thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>No. 4, full of black ash, is wet down with Nos. 1, 2,
and 3, and pumped up to the causticising-tank.</p>

<p>Water is pumped out to Nos. 2 and 3, and then drained
upon No. 4, the liquor still being pumped up from No. 4
while the water is being pumped upon Nos. 2 and 3,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
which are kept full. This is continued until the liquor
tests only 2° to 1° B.</p>

<p>No. 4 is now drained upon No. 1.</p>

<p>No. 3 pumped upon No. 4, and this drained into No. 1
(now full).</p>

<p>No. 3 pumped upon No. 5.</p>

<p>Water pumped upon No. 2 (No. 2 the next to be thrown
away).</p>

<p>No. 5 is by this time full of fresh black ash, and the
same process is carried out with No. 4.</p>

<p class="noindent">In a manufacture such as paper-making, which involves
the consumption of enormous quantities of materials of
variable quality, as soda ash, caustic soda, and bleaching
powder, for example, it will be readily seen that some
means should be at the command of the consumer who
does not avail himself of the services of a practical chemist
at his works, by which he can ascertain the <em>actual</em> value of
the various substances he uses. An art which, up to a
certain point in its progress, is mainly a chemical operation,
it would undoubtedly be more safely and economically
conducted when supervised by persons well acquainted
with chemical principles and reactions, and less dependent
upon individual judgment, than is, perhaps, too frequently
the case. Under such supervision more perfect uniformity
of results&mdash;a consideration of the greatest importance in
a manufacture of this kind&mdash;would be ensured.</p>

<p><b>Examination of Commercial Sodas.</b>&mdash;The methods of
determining the percentage of real alkali in the commercial
products which have received the name of <em>Alkalimetry</em>
are fortunately of a simple character, and such as
a person of ordinary intelligence and skill can readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
manipulate and render thoroughly reliable by exerting the
necessary care. He must, however, be provided with a
few indispensable appliances, which will be described, and
with these he should make several trials upon various
samples until he finds that his results are uniform and his
manipulation easy and reliable. He will require a chemical
balance,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> capable of weighing to the tenth of a grain; a
few glass "beakers" (Fig. 83) of various sizes, capable of
holding from four to eight or ten ounces of fluid; several
glass stirrers; a bottle of litmus solution, made by dissolving
litmus in hot water; books of litmus and turmeric papers;
and several glass flasks (Fig. 84) of various sizes, capable
of holding from four to eight ounces. Besides these
accessories, certain measuring instruments, termed <em>alkalimeters</em>
or <em>burettes</em>, are employed, of which either of the
two following may be employed. These instruments are
of glass, and hold up to 0 or zero exactly 1,000 grains.
The scale is graduated in a hundred divisions, which are
again subdivided into tenths. Bink's burette is shown in
Fig. 85, and Mohr's burette in Fig. 86. The latter, being
provided with a stand, enables the operator to add the test<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
liquor&mdash;with, which the burette is charged&mdash;drop by drop,
when the alkaline solution to be tested is near the point of
saturation, without engaging the hands.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Mohr's Alkalimeter.</b>&mdash;This useful instrument (Fig. 86)
and the method of using it is thus described by Mohr:&mdash;"I
have succeeded in substituting for expensive glass
stop-cocks an arrangement
which may be constructed
by any person with ease,
which remains absolutely
air and water-tight for an
indefinite period, which
may be opened and regulated
at will by the pressure
of the fingers, and which
costs almost nothing. It
consists of a small piece
of vulcanized indiarubber
tube, which is closed by a
clamp of brass wire (Fig.
87). The ends of this
clamp, which I call a pressure-cock,
are bent laterally
at right angles in opposite
directions and furnished
with knobs, so that when
both ends are pressed the
clamp is opened, and a
single drop or a continuous
current of liquid may be allowed to escape at pleasure.
The measuring-tube is a straight glass cylinder, as uniform
as possible, graduated to 0·2 or 0·1 cubic centimètres,
and somewhat contracted at its lower end, so as
to fit into the indiarubber tube. A small piece of glass
tube inserted below the pressure-cock forms the spout.
The pressure-cock has the advantage of not leaking, for
it closes itself when the pressure of the fingers is removed.
The measure, furnished with the pressure-cock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
is fastened upon an appropriate stand, which can be
placed at any required height. When used, it is filled
above the zero point with test liquor, the cock opened
for an instant, so as to let the air escape from the
spout, and the level of the solution is then adjusted.
This is done by bringing the eye level with the zero point,
and applying a gentle pressure to the cock until the liquid
has sunk so low that the inferior curve of the liquid
touches the graduation like the circle of a tangent; the
cock is then closed, and at the same moment the liquid
remains at zero, and continues to do so for weeks if evaporation
is prevented. The test-measure being normally
filled, the experiment may be commenced; this is done
sitting, while the filling of the measure is done standing.</p>

<p>"The weighed sample of alkali is first placed in a
beaker-glass, and the test-liquor is allowed to flow into it
by gently pressing the cock. Both hands are set at liberty,
for when the pressure-cock is released it closes of itself.
The volumetric<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> operation may be interrupted at pleasure,
in order to heat the liquid, shake it, or do whatever else
may be required. The quantity of liquid used may be
read off at any moment, and in repeating an experiment,
the limit of the quantity used before may be approached
so near that the further addition of liquid may be made
drop by drop." The test-acid to be used <em>volumetrically</em>&mdash;that
is, with the alkalimeter, has a specific gravity of
1·032 at 60° F., and 1,000 grains by measure contain
exactly 40 grains of real or anhydrous (that is, without
water) sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>The chemical principles involved in the process of alkali-testing
may be thus briefly stated:&mdash;According to the
laws of chemical combination defined by the atomic theory
of Dalton, all substances combine in <em>definite</em> proportions or
"equivalents"; thus, 1 part by weight of <em>hydrogen</em> combines
with 8 parts by weight of <em>oxygen</em> to form water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
The equivalent number of hydrogen, therefore, is 1, and
of oxygen 8, and that of water 9. Again, 3 equivalents
of oxygen combine with 1 equivalent of sulphur (16) to
form sulphuric acid; thus, sulphur 16, oxygen 24, equals
anhydrous sulphuric acid 40; therefore 40 is the <em>equivalent</em>
or combining number of this acid, and it cannot be made
to unite with alkalies or other bases in any other proportion.
For example, 40 <em>grains</em> by weight of <em>pure</em> sulphuric
acid will neutralise exactly 53 grains of <em>dried carbonate
of soda</em>, 31 grains of <em>pure anhydrous soda</em>, or 40
grains of <em>hydrate of soda</em> (caustic soda). This being so, it
is only necessary to have exactly 40 grains of <em>real</em> sulphuric
acid in 1,000 grains of water to form a <em>test-acid</em>,
which, when employed to neutralise an alkaline solution,
will show, by the proportion of dilute acid used to
saturate the alkali, the absolute percentage present in the
sample.</p>


<p><b>Preparation of the Test-Acid or Standard Solution.</b>&mdash;As
there is some trouble involved in the preparation of
the test-liquor, it is advisable to prepare a sufficient quantity
at a time to last for many operations. It may be
readily made by mixing 1 part of concentrated sulphuric
acid with 11 or 12 parts of <em>distilled water</em>, the mixture being
made in what is termed a "Winchester" bottle, which
holds rather more than half a gallon, and is provided with
a glass stopper. The acid solution must be <em>adjusted</em> or
brought to the proper strength after it has cooled down
to 60° F.; and it should be <em>faintly tinged</em> with litmus,
which will give it a pinkish hue. The acid, to be of the
proper strength, should <em>exactly</em> neutralise 53 grains of
pure carbonate of soda, previously calcined at a red heat,
or 31 grains of pure anhydrous soda. To prepare the
anhydrous carbonate of soda, a few crystals of carbonate
of soda are placed in a Berlin porcelain crucible, and this
must be heated over a spirit-lamp or Bunsen burner.
When all the water of crystallisation has become expelled,
the calcination is continued until the mass is at a bright
red heat, when the vessel may be allowed to cool. 53<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
grains of the calcined carbonate are now to be carefully
weighed, and next dissolved in a glass beaker, in about
2 ounces of distilled water. The alkalimeter is now to be
charged with the test-acid to the level of zero, and (if
Mohr's burette be used) the beaker containing the alkaline
solution is to be placed upon the stand immediately beneath
the exit-tube. Now press the knobs of the pressure-cock,
and allow a portion of the liquor to flow into the beaker.
When the effervescence which immediately sets up subsides,
make further additions of the test-liquor from time
to time, until the effervescence becomes sluggish, at which
period the acid must be added with greater caution. When
the solution approaches saturation it acquires a purplish
tint (due to the litmus with which the acid is tinged),
which it retains until the point of saturation is reached,
when it suddenly changes to a pink colour. After each
addition of the acid the solution should be stirred with a
thin and clean glass rod; and before the final change from
purple to pink, the end of the glass rod should be applied
to a strip of blue litmus paper, when, if the moistened
spot touched assumes a red colour, the saturation is complete;
if, on the contrary, the paper is unchanged, or has
a violet or reddish hue, add the test-liquor, one or two
drops at a time, with continued stirring, until a drop of
the solution applied with a glass rod reddens litmus paper,
when the saturation is finished. If any test-liquor remain
in the burette, this indicates that there is excess of acid in
the test-liquor; consequently more distilled water must be
added to the bulk, the burette emptied and refilled with
the reduced liquor, and another 53 grains of anhydrous
carbonate of soda treated as before, until 1,000 grains of
the acid liquor <em>exactly</em> neutralise the solution. Should the
whole contents of the burette in the first trial be used
before saturation is complete, a little more sulphuric acid
must be put into the Winchester or test-acid bottle, and
a 53-grain solution of carbonate of soda treated as before.
A very little practice will enable the operator to adjust
his test-liquor with perfect accuracy; and, to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
mistakes, the bottle should be labelled "Test-acid," and
always be kept closed by its stopper.</p>


<p><b>Sampling Alkalies.</b>&mdash;Soda-ash of commerce is usually
packed in wooden casks, and in order to obtain a fair
average sample from a large number of these casks, which
may represent one consignment, it is important to take
small samples, as near the centre of each cask as possible,
from as many of the casks as time will permit. Each
sample, as drawn from the cask, should be at once placed
in a rather wide-mouthed bottle furnished with a well-fitting
cork. Each sample should be numbered and marked
with the brand which distinguishes the cask from which
it was taken. The duty of sampling should be placed in
the hands of a person of known integrity and intelligence.</p>

<p>When about to test a sample of soda-ash, the contents
of the bottle should first be emptied upon a sheet of dry
paper, and the larger lumps then crushed to reduce the
whole to a coarse powder, and this must be done as quickly
as possible to prevent absorption of moisture from the
atmosphere. 100 grains of the alkali must now be accurately
weighed and put into a glass flask (Fig. 84), and
the remainder of the alkali returned to the bottle and the
vessel securely corked. About half an ounce of distilled
water is then to be put into the flask and gentle heat
applied, with an occasional shaking, until the alkali is all
dissolved. The flask is then to be set aside for a few
minutes, until any insoluble matter present has subsided,
when the clear liquor is to be carefully poured into a
beaker glass; the sediment must be washed several times
with small quantities of distilled water, and the washings
added to the solution in the beaker. This washing is of
great importance and must be performed several times, or
until the last washing liquor produces no effect upon yellow
turmeric paper, which even slight traces of alkali will turn
a brown colour. So long as this brown tint is given to the
turmeric paper the presence of alkali is assured, and the
washing must be continued. It is important, after each
washing, to pour off the last drop of the liquor above the
sediment, by which the operation is more effectual, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
effected with less water than when this precaution is not
observed. In order to ensure perfect accuracy in the result,
every particle of the washings must be added to the contents
of the beaker-glass in which the assay is to be made.</p>


<p><b>The Assay.</b>&mdash;The alkalimeter is first to be filled with
the test-acid exactly to the line 0 or zero of the scale as
described, and the beaker containing the solution to be
tested then placed immediately beneath the dropping tube
of the instrument; a thin glass rod should be placed in the
beaker as a stirrer. The acid liquor is then allowed to
flow gradually into the alkaline solution (which should be
repeatedly stirred with the glass rod), by pressing the
knobs of the pressure-cock, until the solution assumes a
purple tint, which it will retain until the exact point of
saturation has been arrived at, when, as before stated, it
will suddenly change to a pink colour. Before the latter
stage is reached the beaker should be placed over a spirit
lamp or Bunsen burner, and the liquid heated to expel
the carbonic acid which is evolved, and partly absorbed
by the solution during the process of saturation. When
the neutralisation is complete, the alkalimeter is allowed
to repose for a few moments, so that the acid liquor may
drain from the interior of the glass tube into the bulk of
the fluid, and the quantity of test-acid used is then determined
by reading off the number of divisions of the alkalimeter
that have been exhausted, every one of which
represents 1/100th part, or 1 per cent. of <em>alkali</em>, whenever
the <em>equivalent weight</em> is taken for assay. Every 1/10th part
of an alkalimeter division represents 1/10th of 1 per cent.,
and the result is thus obtained without the necessity of
any calculation. The following table shows the <em>equivalent</em>
or combining proportions of soda with 40 grains of real
(that is, anhydrous) sulphuric acid:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Arnot recommends the following method for alkali
testing: "The sample, which should be a fair average of
the drum or cask from which it is drawn, should, in the
case of caustic soda, be quickly crushed into small fragments,
and returned to the stoppered bottle in which it
was collected for testing. It need not be finely ground,
and, indeed, should not be, as it very readily attracts
moisture from the air. The contents of the drum are
usually pretty uniform, and the crushing recommended
will give the operator a sample quite fit to work upon.
Samples of soda-ash and soda crystals will, of course, be
fairly representative of the casks from which they are
drawn. One hundred grains of the prepared sample must
be weighed out upon a watch-glass or slip of glazed
paper, and transferred to a porcelain basin, with at least
half a pint of boiling water. The watch-glass is preferable
for caustic soda, and the weighing in the case of that
agent must be done expeditiously. While the sample is
dissolving the burette will be charged with the standard
acid. To the soda solution a few drops of solution of
litmus, sufficient to colour it distinctly, will be added. The
acid will then be run into the blue soda liquor; at
first, within reasonable limits, this <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'may done rapidly'">may be done rapidly</ins>, but
towards the close of the operation the acid must be added
cautiously, and the solution kept well stirred. In the case
of caustic, when the blue has distinctly changed to red,
the operation may be considered completed, and the
measures may be read off the burette; and this is, without
calculation, the result required. When the soda in the
sample is a carbonate, the blue colour of the litmus will be
changed to pink before all the soda is neutralised, owing
to a portion of the liberated carbonic acid remaining in
the solution; this must be eliminated by placing the basin
over a Bunsen burner and boiling the solution. The blue
colour will thus be restored, and more acid must be added,
repeating the boiling from time to time, until the red
colour becomes permanent. It is sometimes necessary to
filter the soda solution before testing; this applies specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to recovered soda, and, although in a less degree, to soda-ash."
When the soda solution is filtered, it will be necessary
to thoroughly wash out the liquor absorbed by the
filtering paper, the washings being added to the bulk of
the liquor as before. The best plan is to allow the soda
solution to stand for some time until all the sediment has
deposited, and then to pour off as much of the liquor
as possible, and then to wash the sediment into a very
small filter, in which it will receive further washing,
until no trace of alkali can be detected in the last wash
water.</p>


<p><b>Estimation of Chlorine in Bleaching Powder.</b>&mdash;It is
desirable that the manager or foreman of a paper-mill should
have at his command some ready means by which he may test
the percentage of chlorine in samples of bleaching powder,
or chloride of lime, delivered at the mill, not alone to enable
him to determine the proportions to be used in making up his
bleaching liquors, but also to ensure his employers against
possible loss in case of inferior qualities being delivered at
the mill. Bleaching powders being purchased according
to percentage, it is absolutely necessary that the purchaser
should have this determined to his own satisfaction before
either using or paying for the material. Good chloride of
lime should contain 35 per cent. of available chlorine, but
the powder should not be accepted which contains less
than 32 per cent. There are several methods of estimating
the percentage of chlorine in bleaching powder,
which is composed of hypochlorite of lime, chloride of
calcium, and hydrate of lime, the latter substances being of
no service in the bleaching process.</p>

<p>According to Fresenius, in freshly prepared and perfectly
normal chloride of lime, the quantities of hypochlorite
of lime and chloride of calcium present stand to each
other in the proportion of their equivalents. When such
chloride of lime is brought into contact with dilute sulphuric
acid, the whole of the chlorine it contains is liberated
in the elementary form. On keeping chloride of
lime, however, the proportion between hypochlorite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
lime and chloride of calcium gradually changes: the former
decreases, the latter increases. Hence from this cause
alone, to say nothing of original difference, the commercial
article is not of uniform quality, and on treatment with
acid gives sometimes more, and sometimes less, chlorine.
As the value of bleaching powder depends entirely upon
the amount of chlorine set free on treatment with acids,
chemists have devised very simple methods of determining
the available amount of chlorine in any given sample,
these methods having received the name of <em>chlorimetry</em>.
The method of Fresenius is generally considered both
practicable and reliable.</p>


<p><b>Fresenius' Method</b> of preparing the solution of bleaching
powder to be tested is as follows:&mdash;Carefully weigh
out 10 grains of the sample, and finely triturate it in a
mortar with a little cold water, gradually adding more
water; next allow the liquor to settle, then pour the liquid
into a litre flask, and triturate the residue again with a
little water, and rinse the contents of the mortar carefully
into the flask, which should then be filled with water up
to the graduated mark. Now shake the milky fluid and
proceed to examine it while in the turbid state; and each
time, before measuring off a fresh portion, the vessel must
be again shaken to prevent the material from depositing.
The results obtained with the solution in its turbid
condition are considered more accurate and reliable
than when the clear liquid alone is treated, even though
the deposit be frequently washed. This may be proved,
Fresenius says, by making two separate experiments, one
with the decanted clear liquor, and another with the residuary
turbid mixture. In an experiment made in his own
laboratory the decanted clear fluid gives 22·6 of chlorine,
the residuary mixture 25·0, and the uniformly mixed turbid
solution 24·5. One cubic centimètre of the solution
of chloride of lime so prepared corresponds to 0·01 gramme
of chloride of lime.</p>


<p><b>Gay-Lussac's Method.</b>&mdash;This method, which is known
as the <em>arsenious acid process</em>, has been much adopted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the determination of chlorine in bleaching powders, and is
conducted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>The Test-liquor.</em>&mdash;This is prepared by dissolving 100
grains of <em>pure</em> arsenious acid in about 4 ounces of pure
hydrochloric acid, and the solution is to be diluted with
water until, on being poured into a graduated 10,000
grains measure-glass, it occupies the volume of 700 grains
measure marked on the scale. Each 1,000 grains measure
of this liquid now contains 14·29 grains of arsenious acid,
corresponding to 10 grains of chlorine, or 1/10 grain of
chlorine for every division or degree of the scale of the
chlorimeter, for which purpose a Mohr's burette of the
above capacity may be used, or a graduated tube of the
form shown in Fig. 85 may be employed.</p>

<p><em>Testing the Sample.</em>&mdash;100 grains of the chloride of lime
to be tested are next dissolved in water, and poured into a
tube graduated up to 2,000 grains measure. The whole
must be well shaken in order to obtain a uniformly turbid
solution, and half of it (1,000 grains measure) transferred
to a graduated chlorimeter, which is, therefore, thus filled
up to 0°, or the zero of the scale, and contains exactly 50
grains of the chloride of lime under examination, whilst
each degree or division of the scale contains only ½ grain.
1,000 grains measure of the arsenious acid test-liquor are
now poured into a glass beaker, and a few drops of a solution
of sulphate of indigo added, in order to impart a faint,
but distinct, blue colour to it; the glass is then to be
shaken so as to give a circular movement to the liquid, and
whilst it is whirling round the chloride of lime solution
from the chlorimeter is gradually and cautiously added
until the blue tinge given to the arsenious acid test-liquor
is destroyed, care being taken to stir the mixture well with
a glass rod during the whole process, and to stop as soon
as the decoloration is complete. We will assume that
in order to destroy the blue colour of 1,000 grains measure
of the arsenious acid test-liquor 90 divisions or degrees of
the chloride of lime solution have been employed. These
90 divisions, therefore, contained the 10 grains of chlorine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
required to destroy the colour of the test solution; and
since each division represents ½ grain of chloride of lime,
45 grains of chloride of lime (10 grains of chlorine) were
present in the 90 divisions so employed, from which the
percentage strength may be ascertained:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">For 45 : 10 :: 100 : 22·22.</p>

<p>The chloride of lime examined, therefore, contained 22¼
per cent. (nearly) of chlorine. This method is extremely
simple and trustworthy when properly employed, but to
ensure accuracy certain precautions must be adopted. Instead
of pouring the test liquor into the solution of the
sample (as in alkalimetry), the solution of the sample must
be poured into the test-liquor. If the contrary plan were
adopted the hydrochloric acid of the test-liquor would
liberate chlorine gas so fast that much would be lost, and
the result rendered incorrect. By pouring, on the contrary,
the chloride of lime solution into the arsenious acid
solution the chlorine is disengaged in small portions at a
time, and meets with an abundance of arsenious acid to
react on. The mixture of chloride of lime should also be
employed turbid.</p>

<p><b>Estimation of Alumina in Alum Cake, etc.</b>&mdash;Mr. Rowland
Williams, F.C.S., in a paper read before the Chemical
Society in June, 1888, describes a method of estimating
the alumina in alums, alum cakes, and sulphate of alumina,
by which he obtained more accurate results than are obtained
by the ordinary ammonia method of estimation.
After pointing out several objections to the method of precipitating
the alumina by ammonia, he proceeds:&mdash;"There
is another method for the estimation of alumina which is
not so well known as the above. This is by means of
sodium thiosulphate. Having had a very extensive and
successful experience of this process, I can recommend it
with confidence. Considerable practice is, however, necessary
in order to secure good results, as certain conditions
must be carefully attended to, otherwise the precipitation
will be incomplete. The estimation is made in a moderately
dilute solution. In the case of alum cake and sulphate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of alumina I dissolve 400 grains in water, filter,
dilute to 10,000 grains. I use 1,000 grains of this solution
(equal to 40 grains of the sample) for estimating the
alumina. If any free acid is present it is neutralised by a
few drops of carbonate of soda solution, and the whole
diluted to about 8 ounces measure. A large quantity of
crystallized thiosulphate of soda is then added, and the
liquid boiled for at least half-an-hour, constantly replacing
the water lost by evaporation. By the end of that time
all the alumina will be precipitated in a finely-divided
form, along with more or less free sulphur. The precipitate
is then filtered off and washed well with boiling
water. The filtration and washing take place very rapidly,
and may generally be accomplished in about twenty
minutes, this being a great saving of time in comparison
with the long and tedious washing by decantation, which
is necessary in the case of gelatinous alumina. Before
filtration, it is advisable to add a drop or two of carbonate
of soda solution, lest the liquid should have become slightly
acid during boiling."</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Preparation of Lakes.</b>&mdash;These are prepared by either
of the following processes:&mdash;1. By adding a solution of
alum, either alone or partly saturated with carbonate of
potassa, to a filtered infusion or decoction of the colouring
substance, and after agitation precipitating the mixture
with a solution of carbonate of potash ("salt of tartar").
2. By precipitating a decoction or infusion of the colouring
substance made with a weak alkaline ley, by adding a
solution of alum. 3. By agitating recently precipitated
alumina with a solution of the colouring matter, prepared
as before, until the liquid is nearly discoloured, or the
alumina acquires a sufficiently dark tint. The first method
is usually employed for aciduous solutions of colouring
matter, or for those whose tint is injured by alkalies; the
second for those that are brightened, or at least uninjured,
by alkalies; the third, those colouring matters that have a
great affinity for gelatinous alumina, and readily combine
with it by mere agitation. By attention to these general
rules, lakes may be prepared from almost all animal and
vegetable colouring substances that yield their colour to
water, many of which will be found to possess great beauty
and permanence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The precise process adapted to each particular substance
may be easily ascertained by taking a few drops of its
infusion or decoction, and observing the effects of alkalies
and acids on the colour.</p>

<p>The quantity of alum or of alumina employed should be
nearly sufficient to decolour the dye-liquor, and the quantity
of carbonate of potassa should be so proportioned to
the alum as to exactly precipitate the alumina, without
leaving free or carbonated alkali in the liquid. The first
portion of the precipitate has the deepest colour, and the
shade gradually becomes paler as the operation proceeds.</p>

<p>A beautiful "tone" of violet, red, and even purple may
be communicated to the colouring matter of cochineal by
the addition of perchloride of tin; the addition of arseniate
of potassa (neutral arsenical salt) in like manner
gives shades which may be sought for in vain with alum
or alumina. After the lake is precipitated it must be
carefully collected, washed with cold distilled water, or
the purest rain-water, until it ceases to give out colour.</p>

<p><b>Brazil-wood Lake.</b>&mdash;1. Take of ground Brazil wood
1 lb., water 4 gallons; digest for 24 hours, then boil for
30 or 40 minutes, and add of alum 1½ lb., dissolved in a
little water; mix, decant, strain, and add of solution of
tin ½ lb.; again mix well and filter; to the clear liquid
add, cautiously, a solution of salt of tartar or carbonate of
soda, as long as a deep-coloured precipitate forms, carefully
avoiding excess. 2. Add washed and recently precipitated
alumina to a strong and filtered decoction of
Brazil wood. Inferior to the last.</p>

<p><b>Cochineal Lake.</b>&mdash;1. Cochineal (in coarse powder) 1 oz.;
water and rectified spirit, of each, 2½ ozs.; digest for a
week; filter and precipitate the tincture with a few drops
of solution of tin, added every 2 hours, until the whole of
the colouring matter is thrown down; lastly, wash the
precipitate in distilled water and dry it; very fine. 2.
Digest powdered cochineal in ammonia water for a week,
dilute the solution with a little water, and add the liquid
to a solution of alum, as long as a precipitate falls, which
is the lake. Equal to the last. 3. Coarsely powdered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
cochineal 1 lb., water 2 gallons; boil 1 hour, decant, strain,
add a solution of salt of tartar, 1 lb., and precipitate with
a solution of alum. By adding the alum first, and precipitating
the lake with the alkali, the colour will be slightly
varied. All the above are sold as carminated or Florence
lake, to which they are often superior.</p>


<p><b>Lac Lake.</b>&mdash;Boil fresh stick-lac in a solution of carbonate
of soda, filter the solution, precipitate with a solution
of alum, and proceed as before. A fine red.</p>


<p><b>Madder Lake.</b>&mdash;1. Take of Dutch grappe or crop madder
2 oz., tie it in a cloth, beat it well in a pint of water in
a stone mortar, and repeat the process with fresh water (about
5 pints) until it ceases to yield colour; next boil the mixed
liquor in an earthen vessel, pour it into a large basin, and
add of alum 1 oz., previously dissolved in boiling water, 1
pint; stir well, and while stirring, pour in gradually of a
strong solution of carbonate of potassa (salt of tartar) 1½
oz.: let the whole stand until cold, then pour off the
supernatant liquor, drain, agitate the residue with boiling
water, 1 quart (in separate portions), decant, drain, and
dry. Product, ½ oz. The Society of Arts voted their gold
medal to the author of the above formula. 2. Add a little
solution of acetate of lead to a decoction of madder, to
throw down the brown colouring matter, filter, add a solution
of tin or alum, precipitate with a solution of carbonate
of soda or of potassa, and otherwise proceed as before.
3. Ground madder, 2 lbs.; water, 1 gallon; macerate with
agitation for 10 minutes, strain off the water, and press
the remainder quite dry; repeat the process a second and
a third time; then add to the mixed liquors, alum, ½ lb.,
dissolved in water, 3 quarts; and heat in a water-bath for
3 or 4 hours, adding water as it evaporates: next filter,
first through flannel, and when sufficiently cold, through
paper; then add a solution of carbonate of potassa as
long as a precipitate falls, which must be washed until the
water comes off colourless, and lastly, dry. If the alkali
be added in 3 successive doses, 3 different lakes will be
obtained, successively diminishing in beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>


<p><b>Orange Lake.</b>&mdash;Take of the best Spanish annotta 4 ozs.;
pearlash, ¾ lb.; water, 1 gallon; boil it for half an hour,
strain, precipitate with alum, 1 lb., dissolved in water, 1
gallon, observing not to add the latter solution when it
ceases to produce an effervescence or a precipitate. The
addition of some solution of tin turns this lake a lemon
yellow; acids redden it.</p>


<p><b>Yellow Lake.</b>&mdash;1. Boil French berries, quercitron bark,
or turmeric, 1 lb., and salt of tartar, 1 oz., in water, 1
gallon, until reduced to one half; then strain the decoction
and precipitate with a solution of alum. 2. Boil 1 lb.
of the dye-stuff with alum, ½ lb.; water, 1 gallon, as before,
and precipitate the decoction with a solution of carbonate
of potash.</p>


<p><b>Artificial Ultramarine.</b>&mdash;This is obtained by several
processes, of which the following are examples:&mdash;1. Take
kaolin, 37 parts; sulphate of soda, 15; carbonate of soda,
22; sulphur, 18; and charcoal, 8 parts; mix these intimately,
and heat in large covered crucibles for twenty-four
to thirty hours. The resulting product is then to
be again heated in cast-iron boxes at a moderate temperature,
until the required tint is obtained; it is finally pulverised,
washed in a large quantity of water, and the
floating particles allowed to subside in a separate vessel;
the deposited colour is now collected and dried. 2. Expose
to a low red heat, in a covered crucible as long as fumes
are given off, a mixture composed of: kaolin, 2 parts;
anhydrous carbonate of soda and sulphur, of each 3 parts.
Some persons use one-third less carbonate of soda.</p>


<p><b>Twaddell's Hydrometer</b>, which is much employed for
ascertaining the strength of soda and chloride of lime solutions,
etc., is so graduated and weighted that the 0 or zero
mark is equal to 1,000, or the specific gravity of distilled
water at the temperature of 60° F., and each degree on
the scale is equal to ·005; so that by multiplying this
number by the number of degrees marked on the scale,
and adding 1·, the real specific gravity is obtained. Thus
10° Twaddell indicates a specific gravity of 1050, or 1·05,
and so on.</p>

<p><b>Imitation Manilla Pulp from Wood.</b>&mdash;Mr. George E.
Marshall, of Turner's Falls, Mass., patented a process some
years back by which wood, under the action of hot water,
and under a heavy pressure, acquires the characteristic
colour of manilla. The wood, having been cut as usual,
is placed in a closed vessel or tank capable of resisting
high pressure, if necessary, of 450 lbs. to the square inch,
the material being closely packed. At the bottom of this
tank is an opening with a valve, through which the water,
previously heated to a point above boiling, and below 280°,
is forced by a hydraulic press to such an extent as to
saturate and to completely permeate the wood, and to
soften and drive out of the pores the gum, resins, and
acids; and if the temperature is kept sufficiently hot, it
gives the pulp the desired colour belonging to a finely-made
manilla paper. This may be aided somewhat by the
introduction of a small quantity of some alkaline substance
to act on the acids. The water may be heated in a coil
outside, and forced into the tank by a hydraulic press.
The water thus heated and forced in leaves the wood or
the pulp in the most desirable condition for work and for
colour. Pulp made from wood treated below the boiling
point will be white; but this process is said to secure the
desired manilla colour by raising the temperature to 240°
or 250° for a light pulp, and as high as 280° for a dark
pulp. No pressure is required from the steam above three
atmospheres, but the press may give from 450 to 500 lbs.
to the square inch, and practice has shown that the
greater the pressure the more speedy is the operation on
the wood.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>


<p><b>Testing Ultramarines.</b>&mdash;The sample of ultramarine
should be examined as to its power of resisting the action
of alum solutions, which may readily be done by the
method suggested by Mr. Dunbar:&mdash;"Dissolve the same
amount of each sample in water, and mix in this water
about ½ lb. of pulp. When thoroughly mixed, and each
lot of pulp is well and evenly coloured, add one glassful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of the ordinary mill alum liquor, either from pure alum,
or aluminous cake to each, losing no time over the operation.
Stir each well and continuously with a glass rod,
and note the glasses carefully as to the length of time
each sample keeps its colour." To ascertain the <em>staining
power</em>, so called, of the ultramarine, and at the same time
the tone, or tint, which it will impart when mixed with
pulp, 25 grains of each sample should be mixed with 100
of kaolin or sulphate of lime (pearl hardening) and the
several mixtures then worked up into a paste with a little
water by means of a spatula, when the differences in the
staining power of the respective samples will at once
become apparent if either be of inferior quality. To make
the test more complete, a like amount of commercially
pure ultramarine should be mixed with 100 grains of
kaolin for the purpose of comparison. In this way a
ready judgment may be formed as to the quality of the
sample under examination.</p>


<p><b>Strength of Paper.</b>&mdash;The comparative strength of
samples of paper may he determined by cutting strips an
inch in width from each sample, and suspending these
from a rigid iron bar. Weights are then cautiously
attached to each until the sample breaks, when the difference
in the weights sustained by the respective samples
before the breaking point is reached will determine the
comparative strength of the samples tested. Mr. Parkinson,
of St. George's Road, Preston, furnishes a simple
contrivance for determining the breaking points of paper,
and so comparing their value.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clark manifests what is an innate perception of what is likely to be useful in a pocket-book,
and he is really unrivalled in the art of condensation. Very frequently we find the information
on a given subject is supplied by giving a summary description of an experiment, and a statement
of the results obtained. There is a very excellent steam table, occupying five and-a-half
pages; and there are rules given for several calculations, which rules cannot be found in other
pocket-books, as, for example, that on page 497, for getting at the quantity of water in the shape
of priming in any known weight of steam. It is very difficult to hit upon any mechanical engineering
subject concerning which this work supplies no information, and the excellent index at the end
adds to its utility. In one word, it is an exceedingly handy and efficient tool, possessed of which
the engineer will be saved many a wearisome calculation, or yet more wearisome hunt through
various text-books and treatises, and, as such, we can heartily recommend it to our readers,
who must not run away with the idea that Mr. Clark's Pocket-book is only Molesworth in another
form. On the contrary, each contains what is not to be found in the other; and Mr. Clark takes
more room and deals at more length with many subjects than Molesworth possibly could."&mdash;<cite>The Engineer.</cite></p>

<p>"This appears to be a work for which there should be a large demand on the part of mechanical
engineers. It is no easy matter to compile a book of this class, and the labour involved is
enormous, particularly when&mdash;as the author informs us&mdash;the majority of the tables and diagrams
have been specially prepared for the work. The diagrams are exceptionally well executed, and
generally constructed on the method adopted in a previous work by the same author.... The
tables are very numerous, and deal with a greater variety of subjects than will generally be found
in a work of this kind; they have evidently been compiled with great care and are unusually complete.
All the information given appears to be well up to date.... It would be quite impossible
within the limits at our disposal to even enumerate all the subjects treated; it should,
however, be mentioned that the author does not confine himself to a mere bald statement of
formulæ and laws, but in very many instances shows succinctly how these are derived.... The
latter part of the book is devoted to diagrams relating to Boiler Construction, and to nineteen
beautifully-executed plates of working drawings of boilers and their details. As samples of how
such drawings should be got out, they may be cordially recommended to the attention of all young,
and even some elderly, engineers.... Altogether the book is one which every mechanical
engineer may, with advantage to himself add to his library."&mdash;<cite>Industries.</cite></p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
